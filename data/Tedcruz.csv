Dear President Gay,
Since my letter to you of November 4th to which you did not reply or even acknowledge, I have received substantial feedback and input from senior members of the Harvard faculty about a number of the issues I raised in my letter concerning free speech, antisemitism, and the impact of the Office of Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (OEDIB) at Harvard. I thought to share this feedback with you now as it may inform your testimony and potential questions you may receive from the Congress on Tuesday.

Free Speech at Harvard

In several of your communications since October 7th, you have emphasized Harvard‚Äôs commitment to free speech as the reason why the university has continued to permit eliminationist and threatening language on campus ‚Äì i.e., calls for Intifada (suicide bombings, knifings, etc. of Israeli civilians) and the elimination of the state of Israel ‚ÄúFrom the River to the Sea.‚Äù You explained your tolerance for these protests on October 13th: ‚Äú[O]ur university embraces a commitment to free expression. That commitment extends even to views that many of us find objectionable, even outrageous.‚Äù

In my letter to you, however, I noted that In The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) Free Speech Rankings, Harvard has consistently finished in the bottom quartile in each of the past four years. I note that Harvard‚Äôs ranking has deteriorated each year, receiving its lowest free speech ranking ever for the 2023 academic year, last out of 254 universities with a rating of 0.00, the only university with an ‚Äúabysmal‚Äù speech climate.

After sending my letter, I reached out to the faculty to reconcile your free speech absolutist commitment with Harvard having the lowest free speech ranking of any university. The faculty had a lot to say on this issue, as well as on antisemitism and the OEDIB. Notably, they were willing to share their views so long as I committed to keep their identities confidential. I have quoted their remarks below:

On Free Speech

‚ÄúYears ago, Harvard stopped being a place where all perspectives were welcome.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarvard is a place where loud, hate-filled protests appear to be encouraged, but where faculty and students can‚Äôt share points of view that are inconsistent with the accepted narrative on campus.‚Äù

‚ÄúHarvard became a place where if you toed the party line, there was applause. If you disagree, you are drowned out. The gatekeepers of speech continue to further narrow what they deem acceptable speech.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe primary problem with speech at Harvard is that if you say the wrong thing, you will be cancelled, which leads to self-censorship. The result is what you actually think is not what you say.‚Äù

‚ÄúSaying anything that doesn‚Äôt highlight the importance of slavery and colonialism as animating forces of history is not acceptable speech. Lived experience and ideology become the dominant forces of conversation. All of the courses follow the same playbook ideology. Ideology poses as coursework.‚Äù

On Antisemitism, Support for Hamas, and the Protests Against Israel

When I asked members of the faculty about the causes behind the Israeli/Gaza protests and the tolerance for antisemitism on campus, they explained:

‚ÄúWhiteness at Harvard is deemed fundamentally oppressive. Indigenous peoples are presented as in need of justice and reparations. Jews are presented as white people. It is therefore ok to hate Israel and Jews as they are deemed to be oppressors.‚Äù

I asked: ‚ÄúWhy are the protests only about Israel versus other conflicts in the Middle East and around the globe where Palestinians and other civilians were killed?‚Äù

‚ÄúIsrael is the rare case where we have a hot conflict between people that are deemed ‚Äòwhite‚Äô versus people of color.‚Äù

The Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (ODEIB)

‚ÄúThe primary animating force of the ODEIB is racism-colonialism and the denial of indigenous rights. The ODEIB is a home for people who are perceived to have been victimized.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe ODEIB was meant to include Asians, but it does not. It is focused on communities that experienced colonialism.‚Äù

‚ÄúRecency matters. India is not included because they got autonomy 70 years ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe ODEIB is at the service of black students, to a lesser extent brown students, and to a lesser extent LGBTQ students.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about whiteness versus people of color.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe DEI framework prioritizes people on the oppressed side of the narrative.‚Äù

Hiring Practices at Harvard

One topic which emerged when I spoke to the faculty was the issue of hiring at Harvard, an issue about which the faculty clearly has a lot of consternation.

When I asked why Harvard‚Äôs faculty has shifted sharply leftward in recent years, they explained:

‚ÄúEach department decides whom they want, and the university can accept or reject the candidate. Left-leaning faculty appoint other left-wing faculty because they get to decide whom to hire and promote. It‚Äôs a bit like the Twitter algorithm which continues to feed you the points of view you want to hear. Eventually, each department reaches the tipping point.‚Äù

One senior member of the faculty shared that it is made abundantly clear that they cannot hire new faculty members unless they meet ODEIB requirements. That is, the candidate has to be a woman, person of color, or have LGBTQ+ status. Straight white males are ‚Äúoff the table.‚Äù Asians and those of South Asian (i.e., India) heritage are similarly disadvantaged in the process as they are deemed successful, overachieving minorities.

A number of the faculty bemoaned that in many cases they cannot hire the substantially more qualified person if he is a white or Asian straight male as the proposed candidate ‚Äúhas to be a woman or BIPOC person.‚Äù  I was told that behind closed doors, it is common to hear: ‚ÄúI clearly don‚Äôt think this is the strongest candidate, but we can see where the train is headed. I therefore have no choice but to vote for the [lesser-qualified candidate.]‚Äù

It is made clear to the faculty that Harvard‚Äôs discriminatory approach to hiring should never be acknowledged or written about in an email. One professor said that he has been continually amazed that no one has brought a lawsuit as these practices are clearly illegal.

One faculty member explained that it is not just the administration that has been putting forth these requirements, but that external organizations like The Chronicle of Higher Education (TCHE) do ‚Äúinvestigative reporting‚Äù where they do racial and gender audits of university departments. TCHE publicly scolds university departments that don‚Äôt meet their diversity requirements further reinforcing Harvard‚Äôs requirement for ODEIB-preferred candidates.

On all of the above issues, I know you will not rely on my survey of the faculty. I therefore encourage you to commission a highly credible, third-party firm to do an anonymous survey of the Harvard faculty. I am confident it will confirm and reinforce all that I have outlined above.

Discrimination at Harvard Is Not Limited to Antisemitism

The problems at Harvard are clearly not just about Jews and Israel. It is abundantly clear that straight white males are discriminated against in recruitment and advancement at Harvard. That is also apparently true to a somewhat lesser extent for men who are Asians or of Indian origin. The ODEIB is an important culprit in this discrimination on campus as it sees the world in a framework of oppressors and the oppressed, where the oppressor class includes white males, Asians, Jews and other people perceived to be successful and powerful.

While Harvard claims that it is committed to free expression, in practice free expression appears to only happen ‚Äúbehind closed doors‚Äù or among faculty and students speaking anonymously.

Conservative voices are squelched and often outright cancelled on campus. Tyler J. VanderWeele and Carole K. Hooven are two recent examples.

In March of this year, Mr. VanderWeele, the John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology, a practicing Catholic, was effectively excommunicated from Harvard (saved only by his tenure) when it was discovered he had signed an amicus brief in 2015 which affirmed his view that the definition of marriage was between a man and a woman, and when he surfaced his pro-life views. See: https://t.co/5DnXLAdfNq

Earlier this year, Ms. Hooven, an evolutionary biologist was cancelled and eventually forced to resign because she stated that one‚Äôs sex was biological and binary on Fox and Friends. See: https://t.co/0ipq167Qbm

I am saddened that the Harvard I love has lost its way. I am embarrassed for not having been aware and previously taken the time to investigate these issues until antisemitism exploded on campus. I should have paid more attention as it did not take a forensic analysis to surface and better understand these issues.

Discrimination at Harvard is not just illegal, but it is extremely damaging to our nation‚Äôs competitiveness, which is critically important in a world with growing geopolitical conflict and turmoil. Harvard should be an institution for our best and brightest, taught by our best and brightest who are in search of Veritas and excellence. Russia, China, and our other competitor nations are not selecting their scientific and educational leaders using Harvard‚Äôs diversity, equity and inclusion metrics.

President Gay, beginning with your testimony to Congress on Tuesday, you can begin to address the antisemitism that has exploded on campus during your presidency, the seeds for which began years before you became President. But as I hope you recognize, the issues at Harvard are much more expansive than antisemitism. Antisemitism is the canary in the coal mine for other discriminatory practices at Harvard.

As President you have both the opportunity and the responsibility for addressing these critically important issues. It won‚Äôt be easy for you as I have been told that your recent ‚Äúpivot on antisemitism‚Äù is already making the radical left wing of the faculty highly skeptical of you.

When 34 Harvard student organizations came out in support of Hamas‚Äô barbaric terrorism, it was a wake up call for me. I hope that having to face the Congress on Tuesday will be a wake-up call for you.

277,Asra Nomani,"Hi there @SusanSarandon, this is my mom, my dad and me on the rail trail in Morgantown, West by God Virginia. Let me tell you what it means to be Muslim in America.

First, your backstory: At an anti-Israel protest in NYC, you just said, ""There are a lot of people that are afraid, that are afraid of being Jewish at this time, and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country.‚Äù

Let me give you ‚Äúa taste‚Äù of what it ‚Äúfeels like‚Äù to be a Muslim in America:

‚úÖüá∫üá∏ My dad didn‚Äôt have to become a second-class indentured servant to one of the many tyrants of Muslim countries that use immigrants from India, like my family, as essential slaves. In 1975, after getting his PhD at Rutgers, he was about to go to Libya ‚Äî a Muslim country ‚Äî led by a Muslim, Moammar Qhadafi, to work like a servant with a PhD for a wealthy dictator‚Ä¶but then the phone rang one day and I picked it up‚Ä¶

‚úÖüá∫üá∏ It was West Virginia University calling, and my dad got a job as an assistant professor of nutrition. He got rejected first for tenure but being Muslim in America meant he got a right like everybody got ‚Äî his right to appeal and guess what? He won and he became a full professor. That‚Äôs what it means to be Muslim in America. You get your full rights, like @DrZuhdiJasser has wished for his family in the Muslim nation of Syria, where a Muslim dictator destroys the lives of Muslims.

‚úÖüá∫üá∏ My mom? Being Muslim in America meant she got to live FREE with the wind in her hair, like @AlinejadMasih fights for women in the Muslim nation of Iran to be able to enjoy. 

‚úÖüá∫üá∏ And what did living free mean for my mom as a Muslim in America? It meant in 1981 she got to start a business on High Street in downtown Morgantown, called Ain‚Äôs International. That is something that @miss9afi wished women could have had the right to do in the Muslim nation of Saudi Arabia. But guess what? That entrepreneurship and financial independence is denied Muslim women in so many Muslim countries.

‚úÖüá∫üá∏ That summer my mom started her business, I got on a plane at Pittsburgh airport for Tahlequah, Oklahama, and I went away from home at 16 for a National Science Foundation camp ‚Äî without a male chaperone, a right denied Muslim women and girls in Saudi for so long.

‚úÖüá∫üá∏ In another ‚Äútaste‚Äù of being Muslim in America? My family got a pathway to citizenship. You think the Muslim dictatorship of Qatar allows a pathway to citizenship for Muslim slaves, servants or Palestinian Muslims? Hell no. The Muslim Al-Thani family just buys citizenship for Muslim soccer stars from countries in Africa to steal World Cup wins. But otherwise it treats non-Qatari Muslims like slaves. America? My family waited, took the test, studied the constitution and we are citizens ‚Äî hallelujah!

‚úÖüá∫üá∏ I‚Äôm going to fast forward because this is just a ‚Äútaste‚Äù of what it means to be Muslim in America. In 2002, I fled Pakistan with a souvenir that could have gotten me imprisoned or killed: a baby growing inside of me, a wedding ring not upon my hand. Sharia law makes sex out of marriage a crime in Muslim countries like Pakistan. My body? The mullah‚Äôs tyranny. And even dare to be atheist like @YasMohammedxx? It‚Äôs also a crime punishable by death ‚Äî in Muslim countries but not in America! 

‚úÖüá∫üá∏ Where do you think I came to give birth to my baby in safety and security, without shame? West by God Virginia in the United States of America ‚Äî where we enjoy equal rights as Muslim AmeriCANs, not AmeriCANTs.

This is a ‚Äútaste‚Äù of life for a Muslim family in America. Please don‚Äôt minimize the experience of Jewish Americans by sanitizing the hell that it is for Muslims living in Muslim countries and vilifying America for the  life ‚Äî and freedoms ‚Äî she offers Muslims like my family. Go, live like a Muslim woman in a Muslim country. 

You will come back to America and kiss the land beneath your feet. üá∫üá∏",2023-11-20 05:31:58+00:00

293,Ted Cruz,"This fact check admits I was right that Biden immediately called on Israel not to retaliate against Hamas, because they have to, because it's true. But, so they can defend Biden, they quote ""experts"" anyway saying he's been 100% supportive of Israel. 

Even that is a lie. In reality, the Biden administration immediately called on Israel not to retaliate on Oct 7, deleted the tweet, supported a ceasefire again the next day, then deleted that tweet too. They have been constantly pushing for humanitarian ceasefires that allow Hamas to regroup after Oct 7, and they reportedly told the Israelis not to preemptively defend themselves against Hezbollah. Diplomatically, they tied Biden's Presidential visit to breaking Israel's siege of Gaza. They appeased Iran by not forcefully retaliating to attacks, allowing the international arms embargo to expire after Oct 7 as Iran was resupplying its terrorist armies with missiles, and by providing the Ayatollah with a new $10 billion line in Euros to fund those terrorists. They've had US military personnel on the ground blame Israel for West Bank violence to Congress.

All while coordinating with Qatar to insulate Hamas.

But Washington DC experts say that Biden has been 100% supportive of Israel. These are the people who have been in charge of Middle East diplomacy for decades - which also explains how we got to a place where Iranian terrorists were able to launch the worst one day mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust.",2023-11-21 23:44:03+00:00

318,Ted Cruz,"This fact check admits I was right that Biden immediately called on Israel not to retaliate against Hamas, because they have to, because it's true. But, so they can defend Biden, they quote ""experts"" anyway saying he's been 100% supportive of Israel. 

Even that is a lie. In reality, the Biden administration immediately called on Israel not to retaliate on Oct 7, deleted the tweet, supported a ceasefire again the next day, then deleted that tweet too. They have been constantly pushing for humanitarian ceasefires that allow Hamas to regroup after Oct 7, and they reportedly told the Israelis not to preemptively defend themselves against Hezbollah. Diplomatically, they tied Biden's Presidential visit to breaking Israel's siege of Gaza. They appeased Iran by not forcefully retaliating to attacks, allowing the international arms embargo to expire after Oct 7 as Iran was resupplying its terrorist armies with missiles, and by providing the Ayatollah with a new $10 billion line in Euros to fund those terrorists. They've had US military personnel on the ground blame Israel for West Bank violence to Congress.

All while coordinating with Qatar to insulate Hamas.

But Washington DC experts say that Biden has been 100% supportive of Israel. These are the people who have been in charge of Middle East diplomacy for decades - which also explains how we got to a place where Iranian terrorists were able to launch the worst one day mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust.",2023-11-21 23:44:03+00:00

A group of Republican senators demanded the Biden administration pay attention to the humanitarian and national security disaster at the southern U.S. border after a midnight trip with Border Patrol agents.

Coming face to face with a group of migrants who had illegally crossed into the U.S., Sen. Ted Cruz recounted the ""horrifying"" situation he witnessed in the Rio Grande Valley and, in particular, the plight of children.

‚ÄúThere was another little girl who was 16 years old. She had no family with her,‚Äù Cruz continued. ‚ÄúThere was a little boy who was 15 years old. He had no family with him.‚Äù

There was a 35-year-old man with a 10-year-old little girl. He said he was her father, but it was obvious he was lying.

His arms were grabbing her so tightly, holding her so she could not run away.

Every supporter of open borders should have seen the look of terror on that little girl's face. She was so frightened.

Tragically, there is nothing Border Patrol could do under Joe Biden's policies. They had to process them and then release them into the country.

Under President Trump, the Border Patrol would have done DNA testing to ensure that the man was actually the girl's father, but Joe Biden did away with this policy.
