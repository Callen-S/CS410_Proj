Pediatricians have always treated parents like your bad if you refuse vaccines for your kids so don’t be offended and it’s not new.

I refused multiple vaccines for my kids when they were growing up and told the Ped every time “no.”

And when it comes to the COVID vaccine for kids, I would be a “HELL NO!” every single time they recommend it.

Kids aren’t at risk from COVID but they face risks from COVID vaccines.",2023-12-04 23:27:44+00:00

It was to push the *narrative* that J6 was an insurrection

It was used to punish those who had the audacity to protest a rigged election

They drained MAGA supporters of tens of millions in legal fees and harassed them in the media

That’s why the Cmte never interviewed the Chief of the Capitol Police - to hide the evidence of Fed involvement

That’s why they edited the videos played in hearings - to boost dramatic effect

That’s why they deleted the deposition videos - to cover their tracks

This is also why Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney are no longer in Congress - we fired them for being complicit in this tyranny",2023-12-03 16:08:21+00:00

93,Marjorie Taylor Greene 🇺🇸,"It’s sad that so many people commented here in such hateful uneducated way.

We live in terrible times that so many people have such petty and materialistic views that they think posting up pictures of an animal some one hunted has to be a giant game, decked out in name brand hunting clothes, with the most expensive name brand rifle with the sole purpose to impress people on social media.

I posted this joyfully and said I’m proud of my son for many reasons.

Number one, he did exactly what I asked him to do. I told him a few weeks ago that I wanted him to kill me a deer so we could have the meat for Thanksgiving week and to freeze the rest. 

I’m proud of him because he did exactly what I asked of him when he came home from college this weekend before he went off and did anything else for himself. 

That’s what good kids do. They respect their parents. 

Not only that he sent our whole family a beautiful picture of the sunrise this morning because he loves and appreciates God’s creation and when you go hunting you truly get to enjoy it.

I’m also proud of him bc he cleaned the deer, cut up the meat, and cleaned up after himself.

That’s also what good kids do and that’s what responsible people do. 

So I will say it again I’m so proud of my son Derek!!

I am blessed by him and the food he has provided for our family this week :)

A lot of these naive comments has also made me realize that so many people wouldn’t know how to survive if something really bad happened and they couldn’t go to the grocery store or order Uber Eats from their couch. 

Hunting and Farming are literally basic national security for every country on Earth.

The skills and knowledge on how to hunt and farm should be taught to every generation just as they are taught how read. 

We should not have a generation or two that don’t understand or appreciate basic life skills.

We must fix this because our future ability to survive may depend on it.",2023-11-19 19:57:58+00:00

Besides Trump himself, nobody enjoys the base's trust the way Tucker Carlson does. Nobody else intuitively understands their values, their priorities, or their worries the way they do.

No other VP contender is as battle-tested as Tucker. Like Trump, he thrives under attack and under pressure. He's been targeted and smeared endlessly for seven years, but he's never cracked, never had a breakdown. He's only become more popular. Despite years of digging, his personal life is spotless.

Tucker is the only Republican who can even begin to imitate Trump's rhetorical style. They're the only two men who can keep an audience transfixed speaking for an hour without a single note.

The Democrat plan is to keep Donald Trump stuck in court or even in jail so he can't campaign. Is anybody a more viable Trump campaign surrogate than Tucker Carlson?

And as we know, the vice president is just a heartbeat away from the presidency. If something were to happen to President Trump, God forbid, is there anyone we'd trust more than Tucker Carlson to carry the conservative mantle into the future?

174,KanekoaTheGreat,"🚨THREAD: Tucker Carlson on Duplicated Ballots, Falsified Tally Sheets, and Mail-In Ballot Fraud in Fulton County, Georgia

“It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November (2020). That is not a conspiracy theory. It’s true.

Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA shows large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times. Pay attention to the women wearing yellow at the desk. According to VoterGA, she slides ballots into a scanning machine, removes the ballots, and then reinserts the same ballots. 

This happens multiple times. The question is, how many times were these ballots counted? Was each vote counted more than once? Fulton County won't answer that question. 

Now, one way to know that answer would be to check what are called audit tally sheets. Tellingly, for months after the 2020 election, Fulton County failed to provide more than 100,000 of those tally sheets, including 50,000 of them from mail-in ballots. 

When VoterGA finally forced Fulton County to turn over the tally sheets, the conclusion was stunning. Here's what the audit found. Seven falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals... For example, a batch containing 59 actual ballot images for Joe Biden and 42 for Donald Trump was reported as 100 for Biden and 0 for Trump. 

The seven batches of ballot images with 554 votes for Joe Biden, 140 votes for Donald Trump, and 11 votes for Jo Jorgenson had tally sheets in the audit falsified to show 850 votes for Biden, 0 votes for Trump, and 0 votes for Jorgenson. 

Wait, did you just follow that? 

How is that not flat-out criminal fraud?""",2023-11-10 19:17:55+00:00

New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct
61 Broadway, Suite 1200
New York, New York 10006

Re:      Judicial Complaint Against Judge Arthur F. Engoron
Supreme Court, New York County
Case Name:    New York v. Trump
Index No.:       452564/2022

Dear Commission Members:

I write today to express my serious concerns about the inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance shown by Judge Arthur F. Engoron in New York’s lawsuit against President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization. This judge’s bizarre behavior has no place in our judicial system, where Judge Engoron is not honoring the defendant’s rights to due process and a fair trial. These serious concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is the leading candidate for President of the United States, and it appears the judicial system is being politicized to affect the outcome of the campaign.

Simply put, Judge Engoron has displayed a clear judicial bias against the defendant throughout the case, breaking several rules in the New York Code of Judicial Conduct.

Last year, Judge Engoron told President Trump’s attorney that the former president is “just a bad guy” who Democrat New York Attorney General Letitia James “should go after as the chief law enforcement officer of the state.”[1]

At the start of the trial, Judge Engoron infamously smiled and posed for the cameras.[2] After the defendant won an appellate ruling against Judge Engoron on the appropriate statute of limitations in this case, the judge simply ignored the ruling.[3] Judge Engoron entered summary judgment against the defendant before the trial even began, without witnesses, other evidence, and cross-examination. This, despite the fact there’s disputed material evidence–and there’s no victim of the defendant’s supposed fraud. Indeed, as the trial evidence has made clear, the defendant paid back the sophisticated Wall Street banks, on time, in full, with interest, as agreed.[4] No insurance company paid a penny. And these banks and insurance companies, supposedly defrauded, continue to do business with the defendant. Yet Judge Engoron decreed before trial the defendant somehow committed fraud. Now, the judge is holding a trial–with no jury–to determine how much of Tish James’ requested $250 million in damages–with no victims–he will extract from the defendant. How does this not violate the defendant’s Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial?

And Judge Engoron has made it crystal clear he doesn’t care what the defendant or his attorneys have to say. Indeed, Judge Engoron illegally gagged them. Judge Engoron told the defendant: “We are not here to listen to what you have to say.” He told the defendant’s counsel: “I am not here to hear what he has to say, now sit down!” And Judge Engoron even threatened the defendant’s counsel if he filed a routine motion for a directed verdict: “You better not, Chris!”

Judge Engoron and his staff are partisan Democrat donors. As recently as 2018, Judge Engoron donated to the Manhattan Democrats[5]–even though Section 100.5 says that judges “shall refrain” from “making a contribution to a political organization.”[6]

Section 100.5 also stipulates that a “judge shall prohibit members of the judge’s staff” from contributing more than $500 “in the aggregate during any calendar year to all political campaigns for political office.”[7] Allison Greenfield has served as Judge Engoron's principal law clerk since 2019.[8] In both 2022 and 2023, Greenfield donated in excess of $500 to political campaigns. In 2022 alone, Greenfield donated “$3,335 in political donations to Democrat candidates and causes.”[9] She’s already given more than $1,000 in 2023 to campaigns.[10] When President Trump’s attorneys notified Judge Engoron, Judge Engoron responded by issuing an illegal gag order against President Trump’s legal team.[11]

Judge Engoron has gone on to gag and fine President Trump for merely criticizing Judge Engoron’s law clerk, which is core political speech protected by the First Amendment.[12] If anyone in America must have the constitutional right to speak out against the judge, his staff, the witnesses, or the process, it’s a defendant going through a process he believes is politicized and weaponized against him. To gag a defendant is un-American. It’s an illegal prior restraint on the defendant’s First Amendment rights, which even the progressive ACLU felt compelled to acknowledge after another Democrat judge–D.C. Obama U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan–illegally gagged President Trump.[13] Indeed, three Democrat-appointed judges on the D.C. Circuit have since stayed Judge Chutkan’s illegal gag order.[14]

Judge Engoron put his judgment in serious doubt by issuing a summary judgment citing as evidence of fraud that the Trump Organization said Mar-a-Lago is worth between $426 and $612 million.[15] The Associated Press reported that two top Palm Beach-area real estate agents said that the club’s “sale of a billion dollars or more would be possible.”[16]

In fact, Judge Engoron ridiculously found Mar-a-Lago was only worth somewhere between $18 and $27.6 million. Any https://t.co/0WAaVwsygA search shows that nearly 20 acres of prime real estate in Palm Beach, touching both the Atlantic Ocean and the intracoastal waterway, is worth exponentially more than $18 and $27.6 million. And Judge Engoron had in his hand the sworn deposition of Palm Beach real estate agent Lawrence Moens, who said the Trump Organization’s valuations were “reasonable and below my estimate for the market value of the property each year.”[17] Moens was asked in his sworn deposition about what sort of buyers would purchase Mar-a-Lago, and Moens responded: “I could dream up anyone from Elon Musk to Bill Gates and everyone in between. Kings, emperors, heads of state. But with net worths in the multiple billions.”[18] The judge wrote: “Obviously this Court cannot consider an ‘expert affidavit’ that is based on unexplained and unsubstantiated ‘dream[s].’”[19] Judge Engoron apparently doesn’t understand that expert opinions aren’t “dreams.” And this is yet another example why Judge Engoron demonstrated bad judgment by keeping this case, instead of sending it to the expert judges in the Commercial Division where it belongs.[20]

Judge Engoron’s bizarre and biased behavior is making New York’s judicial system a laughingstock. Former Southern District of New York federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy, who has at times criticized President Trump, recently stated that he views the “whole New York justice system” as “fraudulent.”[21]

Section 100.2(A) states: “A judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.”[22] Judge Engoron has grossly failed to do this. The Commission’s sanctions against Judge Engoron are necessary to bring back credibility to our great state’s legal system. All Americans, including political opponents, must receive due process and equal protection under our U.S. and New York Constitutions. Judge Engoron’s disdain for President Trump and his politics are evident, and the Commission must take corrective action to restore a just process and protect our constitutional rights. Judge Engoron must recuse from this case.

This case is so much bigger than President Donald J. Trump. If Judge Engoron can railroad a billionaire New York businessman, a former President of the United States, and the leading presidential candidate, just imagine what he could do to all New Yorkers. Judge Engoron’s lawlessness sends an ominous and illegal warning to New York business owners: If New York judges don’t like your politics, they will destroy your business, the livelihood of your employees, and you personally. This Commission cannot let this continue.

Thank you for your prompt consideration of this judicial complaint against Judge Arthur F. Engoron for his inappropriate bias and judicial intemperance in New York v. Trump (452564/2022).

Elise M. Stefanik

""Fulton County poll manager Suzi Voyles was sorting through a large stack of mail-in ballots last November when she noticed something odd: several ballots marked for Joe Biden were extremely similar.

One after another, the votes contained perfectly filled ovals for Biden. What’s more, each of the bubbles boasted an identical white void inside them in the shape of a tiny crescent, indicating they’d been marked with toner ink instead of a pen or pencil, per the Epoch Times.

Voyles also noticed that all of the ballots were printed on different paper than the others she’d counted and none were folded or creased, which is standard for mail-in ballots as they come from envelopes.

“All of them were strangely pristine,” Voyles said. She noted that she’d never seen anything like it in her 20 years monitoring elections in Fulton County. 

All but three of the 110 ballots in the stack – which had been labeled “State Farm Arena” – were marked for Biden and appeared to be “identical ballots.”

After Voyles came forward, she was fired as a poll manager by the Fulton County Department of Elections.""

The incident started after the man, Gregory Yetman, fled his home after the FBI tried serving an arrest warrant thanks to USA Today who exposed him.

The small town's mayor, Christopher Slavicek, said the manhunt has frightened the community. 

""A situation like this of course brings heightened anxiety — it's not normal to see FBI agents and vehicles and tanks in your community.""

""You never think something like this will happen in your own backyard.""

FBI agents attempted to serve Yetman with an arrest warrant Wednesday morning after a USA Today investigation publicized the identities of J6 protestors who were videotaped at the Capitol but had not yet been charged or arrested. 

The hit-piece on Trump supporters identified Yetman as an individual who was seen spraying pepper spray towards Capitol police on J6. 

FBI are currently trying to locate Yetman by searching across local hiking trails and bodies of water. 

Earlier this year, Yetman told USA Today he was interviewed by the FBI after the events on J6. ""Everything’s been resolved, everything’s good,"" he said at the time.",2023-11-09 04:11:56+00:00

204,Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸,"🧵 2/2

On the abortion issue.

Republicans lose on abortion because they have for decades allowed democrats to lie about abortion on every level.

Republicans refuse to fight hard against the evil lies of the democrats who claim “abortion is women’s healthcare and a right.”

It is NOT!

Abortion is murder. 

It kills another human being, the most innocent of all. 

Healthcare saves lives. 

Abortion kills lives.

A baby in it’s mother’s womb is not a parasite like democrats say, a baby is God’s beautiful creation and God does not make mistakes and has a plan for every single one of us.

Abortion does not solve a woman’s problem, but having an abortion will leave you scarred for life and regretfully questioning “what if?” for the rest of your life.

Motherhood is the most wonderful blessing and most incredible journey of a woman’s life. Being a mother is something to be proud of, delight in, and yearn for.

Abortion is not birth control but democrats have normalized it so much that it has become so.

Over 63 million people have been murdered in the past 50 years from abortions. 

Abortion is genocide and none of their screams are heard when each of them are slaughtered in their mother’s wombs.

These precious little ones can not fight, can not defend themselves, can not flee the abortionists’s weapons of choice that they use to brutally murder them.

Calling this ongoing genocide “healthcare” is an abomination and political lie that democrats use in order to manipulate women to vote for them and continue the child sacrifices that enable democrats to maintain power.

There is nothing more evil.

Republicans must stop being afraid to stand up to democrats disgusting lies about abortion.

When Republicans boldly speak the truth and present solutions to help women in crisis into motherhood then we will win on this issue.

Many voters vote for candidates and the party that offers solutions and help to solve the problems people are facing.

Producing ads that graphically show the truth of an abortion as a baby is being ripped apart or dies lying on a cold metal trey gasping for air after being ripped out of its mother’s womb is the truth America needs to see versus the democrat’s never ending ads lying to women that baby murder is their right.

Too offensive? No not for America and definitely not for democrats. 

Remember they are the party that supports men dressing in women’s clothes and provocatively showing their genitals to children during street parades or story time and then throw money at them or encourage their children to tip the monsters themselves.

The Republican Party needs to boldly offer the truth, the solutions, and most importantly fight with everything we have to stop communism in America and protect the most innocent among us.

Truth wins when it shines brightly and is not covered or dimmed.

We must powerfully declare the truth.

Our nation’s survival depends on it.",2023-11-08 14:19:16+00:00

216,Ben Bergquam - Real America’s Voice (RAV-TV) News,"⚠️Breaking! Footage from today at the San Miguel gate on the Tohono O'odham Reservation, Arizona, where an estimated 1,500+ illegals crossed into our country just this morning alone. This was after hours of them being picked up and shipped in to Tucson, and after a week of over 14,000 illegal entries in the Tucson Sector. These are unprecedented numbers for this area and it goes right along with what I saw out at the wall in Sasabe. The invasion is getting worse. 

It all appears to be coordinated in an effort to push the crossings to areas where they think the cameras can’t get to in order to prevent the American from being able to see it and to distract from the drugs and people that don’t want to get caught crossing just a few hundred feet away. 

This is not failed policy by Democrats in Washington DC, this is the policy of the cartel Democrats who have sold out our country! They must be held accountable!

323,Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸,"🚨🚨🚨
I will be voting NO on all funding packages for the Ukraine war (as I have from the beginning) and now the Israel war.

We have had over 10 MILLION people illegally cross our border since Biden took office and we are over $33 TRILLION dollars in debt with many major problems afflicting Americans.

The United States government needs to focus on spending American’s hard earned tax dollars on our own country and needs to serve the American people NOT the rest of the world.

I voted YES on both resolutions condemning the attack on Ukraine and the attack on Israel however I will continue to vote NO on spending American’s hard earned tax dollars to fund wars defending foreign country’s borders while our own border is overrun and our own national security is at risk.

Also Ukraine and Israel are very different.

Ukraine is completely propped up by the US and continues to beg for more US tax dollars while Washington fights it’s proxy war with Russia and Israel is a strong thriving independent nation that prides itself on defending their own people. 

Also, there is $3.8 billion dollars readily available to Israel in the Defense approps bill and the State and Foreign Ops bill, but Schumer and the Senate have not lifted a finger to pass those bills and Biden has not signed them into law.

Our Republican House majority and new Speaker Johnson should refuse any more funding bills until the Senate does it’s job and our border is secure.

We’ve done our job in the House and we must keep passing our remaining Approps bills.

The Democrat controlled Senate has passed ZERO percent of the budget, while the House has passed over 70% of the budget.

I’m tired of the games.

I’m tired of the lies.

Nobody has yet figured out publicly who the bespectacled man is. I know. 

He is Taher Herzallah, a leader of American Muslims for Palestine, an organization started by University of California at Berkley ideologue Hatem Bazian, who also started Students for Justice in Palestine -- the virulent anti-Jew, anti-Israel groups on campuses from Harvard to the University of Virginia. Bazian is known as ""Hate 'em Bazian.""

Here is an important fact: Herzallah was convicted as part of the ""Irvine 11"" for conspiracy to deny the free speech rights of the Israeli Ambassador @DrMichaelOren, accosting Ambassador Oren -- one after the next -- as he tried to deliver a speech in 2010 at the University of California at Irvine.

The chosen tactic of Herzallah's network is intimidation. 

In early 2019, Herzallah was part of a group of Muslim establishment leaders, led by @WomensMarch fake feminist Linda Sarsour and Hamas supporter Nihad Awad, founder of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, marching through House Longworth Building to @RashidaTlaib's office to support @Ilhan Omar's burst of anti-Semitism and call anyone who protested ""Islamophobic."" Sarsour ordered her squad to block the door when I tried to enter and they assaulted me. I filed a complaint with Capitol Police and Tlaib. Nothing happened.

In late 2019, I went to a fundraiser for American Muslims for Palestine in Arlington, Virginia, Attorney General @JasonMiyaresVA, and Herzallah blocked my camera as I filmed anti-Israel activist @AbrarOmeish raising money for her race for @FCPSNews school board. Mark Lamont Hill was supposed to be the keynote speaker. He'd just lost his job at CNN for wanting to destroy Israel from ""the river to the sea."" Now he has a show on Qatar's Hamas-supporting propaganda channel, @AlJazeera.

Part of Omeish's speech: indoctrinating kids on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Just last week, Omeish refused to support a resolution to express sympathy for the victims of Hamas' terror attack. Her father, Esam Omeish, hired Anwar Al-Awlaki at Darul Hijra mosque in Falls Church, Virginia. That was the moment that I became a parent advocate. I knew these anti-Semitic, anti-Israel propagandists were heading into our schools with their hate for Jews. 

They flock together. Ilhan Omar went to Omeish's dad's house for her election celebration.

When I saw the video of the bespectacled man accosting Rep. Greene, I knew immediately his identity.

For 21 years, since my friend Danny Pearl's murder, I've been reporting on the extremists within our American Muslim community and, because of Danny's murder as a Jew and son of Israel, I have kept a very close eye on those hell-bent on destroying the state of Israel with a hate for not only Israel but Jews themselves. 

I put that reporting in my book. WOKE ARMY. With everything I see every day, I feel as if I wrote this book for this moment, as a primer for the war we're seeing today against Jews and Israel by far left activists and radicalized Muslims taking over campuses and now the U.S. Congress. I can't believe the people who are coming off those pages to now seize this moment to destroy Israel.  I want you to read the book so you will know what I know. Get it here: https://t.co/ETtXJ7tCrR

And guess what? Herzallah is in those pages. 

In knowing his identity, you will also know that the protest at the U.S. Capitol was not led by ""Jewish protestors in D.C.,"" as the Washington Post reported. 

It was led by that man -- Taher Herzallah -- and the organization he leads -- American Muslims for Palestine, using Jewish organizations like ""Jewish Voice for Peace"" and ""If Not Now"" as cover for their hateful plot against the state of Israel.

I spent the evening making this video because I want you to know what we know as Muslim reformers and ex-Muslims know. It's a long video for Twitter. But I want you to know what I know. And follow @CanaryMission. I thank them for keep detailed documentation on these folks. 

This is what Herzallah said in a clip Canary Mission archived that I've got in the video: ""What if, as Muslims, we wanted to establish an Islamic state? Is that wrong? What if, as Muslims, we wanted to use violent means to resist occupation? Is that wrong?""

To his rhetorical questions, there is one answer: ""Heck yes, it's wrong!""

Men like Herzallah and organizations like American Muslims for Palestine, Students for Justice in Palestine, Emgage, Dream Defenders (which especially also targets @GovRonDeSantis), Council on American-Islamic Relations, Islamic Circle of North America, Muslim Students Association fill my cast of characters. 

They create this unholy alliance with leftist groups like Black Lives Matter and Antifa, and that's why we see them now marching in the streets together. 

And they have one common mission: 

☠️ the destruction of the state of Israel 
☠️the annihilation of Jews from ""the river the sea."" 

I want a peaceful solution for Palestinians. These oganizations and bullies, like American Muslims for Palestine, Students for Justice in Palestine, Bazian and Herzallah, betray the cause of Palestinians. In the comfort of their homes in America, they foment hate, wound collecting and violence, because they refuse to accept the state of Israel.

What must our mission be?

☮️ Transparency
☮️ Support for the Jewish people and the right of Israel to exist as a nation-state. 🇮🇱

If wild reports are true that the inhuman Hamas will execute dozens of civilian hostages, and if it is further accurate that there are rumored Americans among them—and if Americans then are to be executed by Hamas—aside from a military response, the United States will have to change radically its policies in the Middle East.

In the last 32 months they have been proven utterly disastrous. Hamas has gone full ISIS, and is now in addition reportedly beheading captured Israeli soldiers.

Note that the Mahmoud Abbas, “president” for life of the  PNA, and a recipient of U.S. aid, has been cheering on Hamas.

So of course have the usual suspects, such as the hard Western Left, the Ivy-League pampered student crowd, the Squad constituencies, the Taliban, Qatar, especially Iran, the parent of the current mass killing, and even Turkey.

Is it the mass mutilations, the rapes, the desecrations of corpses, the beheadings, the murdering of women, the elderly, and children, that so excites them all—as if they were gleefully watching sacrificial victims marched up to the top of an Aztec temple in ancient Tenochtitlán?

Or rather is their frenzy due to unspoken terror that Hamas at last has gone too far in its premodern savagery? There are now no more of its patrons with the power to call off the IDF. And so they may finally get the existential war that Hamas always for decades had bragged about and begged for.

And the proper response to all this here in the U.S.?

All monies to the West Bank and Gaza should be immediately cut off. The Iran transfers, if our State Department’s pleas are correct that they are not yet finalized, should be stopped immediately.

Sanctions and embargos should be placed on all Iranian exports. The alternative would be to keep subsidizing those who provide the wherewithal for murderers, rapists and precivilizational mutilators.

If it is true that Hamas killer-masterminds have been residing in Qatar, and, as often has been alleged, enjoying Qatar as a financial clearing-house for terrorist operations, and given Qatar has been blaming Israel for its own murdered, then why do we persist in basing the United States Central Command (USCC) and United State Air Force Central Command (USAFCC) at Qatar government facilities?

There are, of course, realist arguments for our relationship with Qatar. But the world in the Middle East has now irrevocably changed and we need to make the necessary adjustments and separate from this de facto Al Jazeerist enemy.

Expect some terrorists to attempt to join the swarm at our open border. And soon “refugees” from Gaza and the West Bank will be likely demanding asylum here in the Great Satan.

In reaction, we should not only bar all travel from Palestinian territories into the US, as well as from Iran and Qatar, but yank all visas of any of those nationals who currently reside in the U.S. and send them home to enjoy the advantages now offered on nightly video displays in their own native countries.

The national security team of this administration—gifts from the failed Obama administration that is responsible for much of the current Middle East mess— remains confused and inept.

And that’s a charitable assessment. It of course starts at the top.  Joe Biden is neither physically nor cognitively up to the task of Commander in Chief in a crisis. He has more or less disappeared other than offering an occasionally brief appearance where he mumbles about standing with Israel and then vanishes again.

Secretary of State Anthony Blinken recently deleted a tweet calling for an immediate cease-fire–music to the ears of Hamas and Iran.

Why? Does he believe it is moral to allow Hamas to murder 900 Jews, beat their chests about such savagery, and then head home with human trophies to be tortured and executed without a response?

Blinken  noted that he and the Turkish foreign minister had talks that led to such an absurd statement.

And what about Turkey, the erstwhile Obama key to the Middle East?

Its intrusive armed drone was shot down recently in Syria by the US Air Force and remains an unapologetic pro-Hamas partisan.

And whether long-term it can remain in NATO—long opposing Sweden’s entry, chronic overflights of the Greek islands in the Aegean, supplier of weapons to Russia, threatening to send missiles into Athens, a security risk anytime it receives US weapons—is a real concern, given it has the largest, non-US army in NATO and hosts a nuclear-armed U.S. base.

Blinken also blasted critics who deplored his outreach to Iran, disparaging them as misinforming and misinformed.

He is petulant because he knows that the Iranian expectation of an upcoming $6 billion US-driven cash transfer (another sick idea to buy back hostages from a murderous Tehran) gives them in the here and now fungible opportunities to send more cash and arms into the hands of anti-Israeli terrorists.

As far as Iran’s role in the Hamas orgy of killing, Blinken also declared that there is no evidence of  ""anything that shows us that Iran was directly involved in this attack, in planning it or in carrying it out.”

No one but you, Secretary Blinken, believes that.

When one remembers Blinken’s Palestinian Affairs office in the State Department and its even worse ceasefire tweet, which, like Blinken’s, disappeared without comment, the appointment of the Iranian megaphone Robert Malley (currently under investigation by the FBI) as our point man on the bankrupt Iran Deal, and Blinken’s recent brag about all the hundreds of millions of dollars we have sent to the Palestinians, the picture is one of partisan incompetence.

That pattern goes all the way back to the 2021 Chinese humiliation in Anchorage of both Blinken and Jake Sullivan.

Or perhaps both were suspect even earlier when we recall it was campaign honcho Blinken who on the eve of the 2020 election apparently thought up the nasty idea of calling on ex-interim CIA director Mike Morell to round up 51 intelligence “authorities” to lie to the American people that the Hunter Biden laptop under FBI wraps was somehow a product of “Russian disinformation” and not authentic (a claim even Hunter Biden could not make).

That gambit was designed to fuel Biden in the upcoming debate and indeed warp the election itself. And it did.

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has a similar politicized record, as one of the principles seeding the 2016 Clinton-campaign lie that a mythical Trump server was communicating with the Russians and thus proof of “Russian collusion”.

Sullivan, remember, just a week before the Hamas slaughter assured us that ""The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.”

His clear-eyed realism, raw projection of national strength, and his rejection of ideology in favor of pragmatism and national interest, brought us an unprecedented era of global harmony.

Whereas the DC set prattles on endlessly about the rules-based international order — the bloodless and esoteric obsession of the grad school credential class divorced from the iron laws of history — Trump understood the forces that shape world events: relationships, resources, rivalries, and the rational pursuit of self-interest and self-determination.

He understood you cannot impose an ideology over the essential nature of nation and man.

Instead of wasting away America’s diplomatic and financial assets trying to forcibly impose our values across the planet — which consistently yields the opposite effect  — he focused on the formation of mutually-beneficial partnerships to foster global stability.

And he used our economic leverage as deterrence rather than fritter it away on nation building: knowing that a country which seeks to protect its own economic interests will always command more respect and find more common ground in its dealings with foreign powers.

Biden trashed it all. Set it all ablaze. His Administration’s toxic blend of idiocy, imbecility, incompetence and ideological extremism has turned calm into calamity. Peace into pandemonium. Harmony into hell.

The message sent and received by our our humiliation in Afghanistan, our cash bonfire in Ukraine, our internal repression as we preach “democracy,” our cultural self-flagellation, self-abasement and the self-annihilation of our own border, is that we are not a country to be taken seriously only taken advantage of.

679,Marjorie Taylor Greene 🇺🇸,"RT @mrddmia: Don’t be fooled.

Today's indictment of Hunter Biden for gun felonies is just more coverup by Delaware U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who has protected the Bidens for years.

Weiss, handpicked by both Democrat home-state senators in Delaware, let the statute of limitations expire on serious tax charges, buried evidence deemed credible by the Pittsburgh U.S. Attorney of the Bidens' alleged foreign bribery schemes, and attempted to give Hunter a sweetheart deal with secret, broad immunity that protected President Biden.

President Biden knows he cannot pardon Hunter right now. That would lead to politically and legally disastrous consequences before November 5, 2024. If pardoned, Hunter can no longer plead the Fifth Amendment--and refuse to testify before Congress. Hunter’s Fifth Amendment protections also disappear if Weiss gives Hunter a plea agreement with a prosecution waiver or some other immunity deal that shields him from criminal charges.

Weiss's charges today continue his deceptive pattern--for years--of protecting Hunter. More troubling, Weiss is protecting President Biden. Indeed, where are Hunter’s charges related to foreign corruption, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, tax evasion, wire fraud, and other criminal charges that could implicate President Biden?

President Biden and Weiss will rescue Hunter after the 2024 election. Weiss will give Hunter another sweetheart deal. President Biden will pardon Hunter—and maybe even himself. Hunter will not spend a day in jail.

Most troubling, there are credible allegations--with corroborating evidence--the President of the United States may be compromised by foreign bribes and other corruption.

The Biden Justice Department will now point to Hunter's indictment, pretend there's an ongoing investigation and prosecution, and refuse to produce any records to--or answer any questions from--Congress, the press, or the public.

The House may consider granting Hunter immunity now. The Biden Justice Department will never seriously prosecute Hunter anyway. The House should force Hunter to testify.

Knowing whether the President is compromised is much more consequential than a no-jail-time felony conviction for a crackhead with a gun.

If Hunter obstructs or lies, the Trump Justice Department will prosecute him after January 20, 2025.",2023-09-14 18:42:20+00:00

Today’s move by Merrick Garland to appoint David Weiss as Special Counsel to investigate (and in reality cover up) Hunter Biden’s criminal career is the latest action in a continuous pattern of corrupt behavior by Joe Biden and his regime. Behavior typically only seen in juntas in third-world nations or early twentieth-century dictatorships in Europe.

This is a cover-up, plain and simple. This appointment is designed to protect Joe Biden from his exposure to the serious and substantial investigation Republicans are conducting in Congress. This move establishes a firewall to protect the Biden family from their crimes of influence peddling and selling access to “The Brand,” former Vice President Joe Biden. Every subpoena, every record request, every transcribed interview, or any other effort in an impeachment inquiry will be be blocked by this corrupt and unlawful Special Counsel under the guise of an “investigation.”

Republicans, including the House Oversight Committee, have revealed more information on the crimes of Joe Biden and his son in just seven short months than the corrupt DOJ, especially David Weiss, have in years. That’s exactly why this plot to obfuscate, distract, and ultimately cover-up the Biden Crime Family’s corrupt business model is unfolding before our eyes.

The U.S. Attorney appointed today, David Weiss, is totally unqualified to conduct any sort of investigation into Biden crimes. Weiss has been derelict in his duty to prosecute Hunter Biden by ignoring mountains of evidence of tax fraud, evasion, and other crimes presented by brave IRS whistleblowers. Weiss has ignored mountains of evidence, most notably the famous FBI 1023 form directly linking Joe Biden to millions of dollars in payments by Burisma executives to have a Ukrainian prosecutor removed from office. And after all of this, Weiss gave Hunter Biden a sweetheart deal on serious charges where he wouldn’t face a day in prison. The entire prosecution of Hunter Biden by Weiss has been a coverup.

Not only is David Weiss unqualified to conduct this “investigation,” his appointment by Garland is illegal and violates federal statute. The qualifications clearly state: “The Special Counsel shall be selected from outside the United States government.” David Weiss is currently the U.S. Attorney for Delaware. Joe Biden’s Attorney General is breaking the law right in our face!

All of this is happening while President Trump is facing criminal charge after criminal charge in a political persecution like we’ve never seen before in America. Another DOJ Special Counsel, Jack Smith, has launched an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment, on President Trump and on his supporters. This two-tiered system of injustice being rolled out in our country is designed to scare the hell out of Biden’s political opposition and force us into the shadows.

If you fall in line with the regime, you won’t be punished for the most egregious crimes, but if you dare oppose the regime, your life will be ruined and you’ll be thrown behind bars. There is no clearer example than the treatment of violent and murderous BLM rioters, who had their charges dropped, compared to J6ers, who have been locked up for years.

Republicans have no other choice but to stand up against this unprecedented tyrannical regime and IMPEACH.

Joe Biden must be impeached. Merrick Garland must be impeached. David Weiss must be impeached. Jack Smith must be impeached. Virtually, every person in Biden’s corrupt, tyrannical regime should be impeached, convicted, and removed from office.

But they are telling you the most important thing they are doing is indicting President Trump for January 6, 2021. 

As if anyone is actually waking up at night in sweats over January 6th and terrified that Republicans care about election integrity and that no Democrat ever said stolen election - but sure these are the scariest things Americans face daily. 

Yeah while they ALL supported violent BLM riots that destroyed $2 billion in private property in  communities across America that killed people and attacked police day and night, while they violated your rights locking down our country over a man made biological weapon that was like the flu for most of the healthy population especially children, forced you to take an experimental vaccine that killed people with strokes, blood clots, myocarditis, and has left people with serious health issues, and are forcing our country and Americans pay for it all switching us to unreliable electric cars run by Chinese made toxic batteries, Chinese made bird killing wind turbines, and stop using reliable U.S. oil, gas, and clean coal bc the climate gods said we must achieve the unachievable net zero carbon - which will make electricity scarce and unaffordable for most Americans plunging us literally into darkness.

Unchecked government power wielded to imprison the ruling party’s chief opposition, to hound and harass his supporters, to seek the financial destitution and ruin of those who decline submission.

How, in this environment, could any supposed critic of the Deep State question President Trump over the legal bills he has amassed battling this very Deep State? What is the alternative? To allow the Deep State to wage its campaign of personal destruction and national election interference uncontested? To let them run roughshod over the voters without so much as a reply brief? What could be a more righteous, virtuous and necessary expenditure of funds than to fight for liberty and justice against those who seek to rob America forever of both?

The government — state, local, federal — is spending tens upon tens of millions of dollars in its quest to crush this movement. Should the movement allocate no funds for its defense? Just yield? Surely no one who opposes unjust state power believes this. Surely.

For those concerned about funds for ballot harvesting—the simple answer is for the GOP to unite behind the clear will of the clear majority of GOP voters.

Is this why Biden has America involved in the war in Ukraine???

Joe Biden is a criminal and is compromised!  And he is leading us into WW3 bc Zelenskyy has proof of more Biden crimes.

This is the FBI’s FD-1023 UNCLASSIFIED form from the FBI’s most trusted informant that reveals then VP Joe Biden took a $5 million dollar bribe from Zlochevsky to get Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin fired.

Joe delivered by withholding $1 billion in US aid until Shokin was fired.

We were only allowed to see this unclassified form in a SCIF, but I took notes and told you all exactly what it said. Thank goodness Chuck Grassley had a copy from a courageous whistleblower and released it today! 

But this form is dated June 30, 2020 and nothing was done. Bill Barr was AG at the DOJ and could have prosecuted, instead he handed it off to another US Attorney that did nothing either.

Also in 2020, before the presidential election, the FBI had the Hunter Biden laptop filled with evidence of multiple crimes including the same proof I showed during the Oversight hearing that Hunter payed prostitutes through his law firm and made sex tapes and posted them on porn sites. All of this was known and reported by banks in SARs reports and on Oversight we have proof of these payments in bank statements.

I ran out of time in the hearing yesterday, but wanted to ask the IRS whistleblowers if Hunter made money (income) by posting many sex tapes with victims he was paying to travel across state lines for sex (Mann Act violation)? 

If so did he report his sex tape income and pay taxes on it?   I think we all know the answer.

The Biden’s are the most corrupt criminals to ever hold the highest power in the land. 

Republicans can no longer delay, but we need 218 Republican votes to do it.

“It is my enormous privilege to endorse President Donald Trump for re-election. Joining the first Trump campaign in its early days, I saw then what the whole world has learned since: that President Trump is a once-in-a-lifetime transformative leader who possesses the rare combination of skills, insights, wisdom and otherworldly determination necessary to save America from those who would destroy her.
 
He left a life of comfort and wealth to endure abuse and persecution few can imagine. At so many points, at so many times, he could have walked away, spared himself, grabbed a golden parachute, but instead he sacrificed all he has built so that we might be free again.
 
Doing more to change our politics than any leader since Andrew Jackson, Trump inherited a Republican Party that was globalist, donor-centric and unabashedly neoconservative — destined for a generations of nominees and party figureheads in the mold of George Bush and his protégés — a party whose zeal for unrestricted free trade, unceasing foreign wars and unending open immigration threatened to sink the whole American experiment. Trump saved the party from itself — and thus the hopes of America, by creating a political party vehicle for nationalist populism and America First patriotism.

He delivered peace to a world at war.
 
Prosperity to a country in decline.
 
And he sealed the border in the face of domestic legal and political and international opposition on a scale that defies description.
 
Whereas presidents of both parties before him laid down the welcome mat for global mass migration he banned travel from unsafe nations; ended refugee pipelines; suspended whole immigration programs; marshaled state power to stop visa overstays; restored consular affairs to a mission in defense of America not in support of foreign nationals; rewrote the foreign affairs manual to protect our interests; issued arguably the most important domestic regulation in history (public charge); and instituted the most comprehensive sovereign deportation strategy ever developed to end catch-and-release both at and between our ports, and across the whole US, to repatriate nationals to scores of countries across the globe — defeating a deep state and a leftwing judicial state that was hellbent on thwarting his each and every move.

He achieved energy independence. Successfully implemented a more ambitious deregulatory agenda than any President in modern history. Restored tariffs to the fore of our economic arsenal, reviving the patriotic mercantilism that built the American economic powerhouse.
 
He changed the entire paradigm on China.
 
He changed the entire paradigm in the Middle East.
 
He made millions of Americans felt seen and heard for the first time in their lives.
 
And he did it all while battling a deep state coup.
 
Now, the same forces who tried to frame him, who tried to remove him, who broke every rule in the book to try to stop him, are trying to jail him.
 
Why? Because they know if he gets back into the Oval Office he will stop them. Stop them from cheating and bleeding and ransacking our country. Stop them from taking your voice and your vote. Stop them from illicitly spying and censoring and dragging us into military conflicts that yield only pain and hardship.

Why? Because they know if he gets back into the Oval Office he will stop them. Stop them from cheating and bleeding and ransacking our country. Stop them from taking your voice and your vote.

Remember when they stole the presidential primary election from Bernie Sanders?

Democrat voters don’t even get a choice just like the country won’t get a choice without serious work to protect 6-7 key state elections that didn’t change their election laws.
