1,Lindsey Graham,"I know Secretary Austin did not mean to incentivize Hamas and extend the war through his comments.  However, I fear that is exactly what he did at the Reagan Forum on Saturday when he said Palestinian civilian casualties in Gaza would end up being a strategic failure for Israel.

Hamas‚Äô blueprint of using the Palestinian people as human shields makes it even more difficult for Israel to achieve its goal of destroying Hamas.  Let‚Äôs be clear, it is Hamas who is putting Palestinian lives at risk ‚Äì not Israel.  We should urge Israel to be cautious, but the strategic failure I hate ‚Äì and the world will regret ‚Äì is to leave Hamas standing.
 
In essence, Secretary Austin has told Hamas what losing for Israel looks like and I am sure Hamas will seize the moment.

Forget it. They should be sending these migrants to YOU. https://t.co/WOVG5zjS91",2023-12-03 22:48:58+00:00
3,Lindsey Graham,"Vice President Harris is wrong.

Hamas still standing when this is over would be the ultimate strategic failure. https://t.co/2rrE5DguA3",2023-12-03 17:06:21+00:00
4,Lindsey Graham,"Sec. Austin is wrong to suggest that strategic defeat for Israel would be inflaming the Palestinians.

Strategic defeat is letting Hamas stand. https://t.co/5xilJSH9Ia",2023-12-03 15:31:54+00:00
5,Lindsey Graham,"The appeals court decision allowing civil lawsuits against President Trump for political speech is unnerving. I'm hopeful the Supreme Court will correct this ruling.

If the courts want to continue down the path of punishing political speech, perhaps @VP Kamala Harris could be sued because she was actively raising bail money for rioters in Minnesota?

It seems that raising bail money for those involved in rioting would encourage even more rioting and the individuals to commit other illegal acts.  

A very slippery slope here.

However, when illegal immigrants are shipped away from the border to other states ‚Äì like New York ‚Äì their elected officials scream to high heaven.
¬†
Our border is beyond broken.¬† We are being overrun.¬† We simply cannot take more and we cannot continue to allow our asylum laws to be abused.
¬†
The answer is not to provide more money to Blue States like New York for housing.
¬†
The answer is to STOP the flow.¬† The Democrat Party‚Äôs preferred solution of ‚ÄúRemain in Texas‚Äù is not going to work.

That undermines Mr. Garland‚Äôs claim that the probe was free of political interference. If Mr. Weiss did have the freedom to ask for special-attorney privileges, why didn‚Äôt he pursue the charges that his team spent years investigating and recommended?
