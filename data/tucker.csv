""I think looking back on this ten years from now, assuming we're still around, I think we're going to see Trump's emergence as the most significant thing that happened in American politics in 100 years, because he reoriented the Republican Party against the wishes of Republican leaders.""

""I'm struck by his foreign policy views. You know Trump is the only person with stature in the Republican Party really who is saying wait a second why are we sending an endless war in Ukraine. Leaving aside whether Trump is going to get the nomination or get elected President or would be a good President, I can't even asses that, all I can at this point is I'm so grateful he has that position. He's right and everyone in Washington is wrong, everyone. And Trump is right on that question and it's a big question. That war is reshaping the world. It's reshaping the economy of the world. It's reshaping populations.""

""Europe will never be the same because of this war and it really matters, and Trump alone among popular figures in both parties understands that and I'm grateful for that.""

90,The Columbia Bugle üá∫üá∏,"Tucker Carlson Discussing Donald Trump On @rustyrockets's Podcast

""I think looking back on this ten years from now, assuming we're still around, I think we're going to see Trump's emergence as the most significant thing that happened in American politics in 100 years, because he reoriented the Republican Party against the wishes of Republican leaders.""

""I'm struck by his foreign policy views. You know Trump is the only person with stature in the Republican Party really who is saying wait a second why are we sending an endless war in Ukraine. Leaving aside whether Trump is going to get the nomination or get elected President or would be a good President, I can't even asses that, all I can at this point is I'm so grateful he has that position. He's right and everyone in Washington is wrong, everyone. And Trump is right on that question and it's a big question. That war is reshaping the world. It's reshaping the economy of the world. It's reshaping populations.""

‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs aggression against Ukraine is a national security issue that threatens our alliances and our standing in the world. Our objective is to assist Ukraine sufficiently to enable them to defeat Russian forces and restore their sovereignty. This effort is not about regime change in Russia; it is about respecting the sovereignty of free nations. Also, this is a proxy war being waged by Russia‚Äôs ally China against the United States. Due to their assistance to Russia and China‚Äôs recent action in the Middle East, it would be naive to call this anything but Chinese aggression.  Our allies and our enemies are watching us. It is on us to assist our democratic allies in defending themselves against authoritarian aggression. If we do not, this aggression will spread and the void we leave will be filled by authoritarian regimes like China, Iran, North Korea and an empowered Russia if they triumph over Ukraine.‚Äù",2023-03-14 01:15:24+00:00

In addition to that, we are not going to simply degrade the Russian military. We are gonna have accountability for every single dollar spent. There is no such thing as a blank check. We are going to make sure that there's accountability. And the last point I'd make on the Ukraine front is that China has chosen a side.

‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs aggression against Ukraine is a national security issue that threatens our alliances and our standing in the world. Our objective is to assist Ukraine sufficiently to enable them to defeat Russian forces and restore their sovereignty. This effort is not about regime change in Russia; it is about respecting the sovereignty of free nations. Also, this is a proxy war being waged by Russia‚Äôs ally China against the United States. Due to their assistance to Russia and China‚Äôs recent action in the Middle East, it would be naive to call this anything but Chinese aggression.  Our allies and our enemies are watching us. It is on us to assist our democratic allies in defending themselves against authoritarian aggression. If we do not, this aggression will spread and the void we leave will be filled by authoritarian regimes like China, Iran, North Korea and an empowered Russia if they triumph over Ukraine.‚Äù",2023-03-14 01:15:24+00:00
