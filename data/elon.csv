13,Bill Ackman,"I thought @elonmusk’s interview with @andrewrsorkin was one of the great interviews ever. Musk is a free speech absolutist which I respect. I think he is entirely correct that he and @X are treated unfairly and inconsistently by advertisers. 

@tiktok_us @instagram @facebook and others have enormous amounts of problematic content, antisemitic and otherwise, but the advertisers don’t boycott those platforms. 

Musk is targeted because the other media organizations view @X as a competitor and any time his name is in an article about controversies, it draws clicks. MSM is incentivized to attack him as it actually drives attention to their sites and therefore more revenues. It is these attack articles by other media organizations that put pressure on the @Disney’s of the world to stop advertising on X. 

If Bob Iger would carefully examine the facts, he would likely continue to advertise on X, but Disney caves to public pressure rather than do the right thing. Meanwhile Disney invests heavily on TikTok, likely alongside videos of kids teaching other teenagers to be anorexic and worse.  I am sure Nelson Peltz can fix this when he joins the Disney board. 

X presents the opportunity for advertisers to access an incredible global audience that is not available elsewhere. And it is cheap compared to other alternatives because of current circumstances.  

On Musk and antisemitism:

After examining the facts, it was clear to me that Musk did not have antisemitic intent when he responded with the ‘actual truth’ tweet, and further clarified thereafter. 

I thought he made what he meant extremely clear in the @andrewrsorkin interview, namely, that Jews are drawn to support ‘oppressed’ groups and causes through various non-profits due to our history of being an oppressed minority. 

Musk points out correctly that a number of these organizations and their members support Hamas. And he is correct in saying that Jews should rethink support for organizations that seek their elimination. 

Many Jews are doing that right now. 

To use a Muskism, Earth is fortunate that @X is owned by an individual that is largely insulated from financial and other influence.  That said, perhaps some form of very carefully governed trust would be a better forever owner than any individual. 

@PershingSqFdn invested in the Twitter privatization in support of free speech. Whether we make a profit on our investment is not important to us as we never intend to sell our interest. 

I am more inclined to like and support companies that advertise on the platform because I appreciate their support for free speech. I have actually bought products I learned about from ads on @X. I can’t think of another example of my responding to direct advertising other than on X. 

Unfortunately, recent (and society’s long-term experience) with non-profit governance, see @OpenAI, certain private universities etc. should not give anyone confidence that a traditional non-profit would be a better owner of X than Musk. 

Perhaps some day the ownership of X should be distributed to each American, one share for each American during their lives and one for each person born, with a charter which permanently vests the free speech principles by which it operates. 

Until then, we all should be grateful that X is owned by Musk.",2023-12-01 04:23:27+00:00

38,KanekoaTheGreat,"Glenn Greenwald says corporate journalists are losing their minds over @elonmusk calling out major corporations for stifling free speech because they are in bed with the very corporations they claim to scrutinize.

@ggreenwald explains that we are at a crossroads where journalism, once a watchdog of establishment power, is now shackled by corporate advertisers.

""What went wrong here is not what Elon Musk said. It's so revealing that so many journalists are aghast that anyone would dare tell Disney and major corporations to go f**k yourself when they're trying to limit, censor, and control the flow of political content.

If you aren't willing to say that to corporations who are trying to limit what you can say, don't bother calling yourself a journalist.

We need way more journalists willing to say, go f**k yourself to people who try and limit what they say. 

The problem is, is that the people who are hired by these major media corporations, and who thrive in them and succeed in them are people who have the opposite instinct.

Their instinct is to assuage and serve and placate establishment power, not to defy it. Even though the purpose of journalism is to be adversarial to establishment power.

Once journalism started getting corporatized no longer owned by families dedicated to journalism or local communities but by major corporations that have all kinds of other interests besides their media division. And, what kind of attributes are awarded at major corporations? 

People who avoid controversy who avoid conflict, who avoid displeasing and angering powerful people. That's the corporate ethos, and the corporatization of media meant that that kind of attribute was imported into journalism. 

And that's why almost no one who works for large media corporations or the media corporations themselves has the courage to say this. They're shocked. They think it's a sign that he's unhinged when in reality, it's just a sign of how cowardly and craven they are.""",2023-11-30 05:44:18+00:00

As always, everything is open source, including the data.",2023-11-20 19:04:13+00:00
175,Community Notes,"Another big quality update:

We’ve enhanced the open source scoring algorithm’s ability to spot potentially inaccurate or unsupported notes. How it works: The algorithm identifies notes that people from a wide range of viewpoints agree have potential issues with accuracy or source support. It then identifies raters who consistently and precisely spot such notes, and assigns them extra weight, enabling faster and more precise identification of notes with these issues.

Raters are effectively given more weight for being diligent about vetting details of notes and following the cited sources to verify. Quick ratings that miss errors in notes, or that excessively rate notes as erroneous, lead to reduced weight. The more diligent you are as a rater, the more impact you can have.

The precision of this new approach not only results in additional helpful and informative notes being displayed on X, it also identifies more notes that people from different points of view agree have possible accuracy or source support problems.

According to David Juul Ledstrup, Chief Strategy Officer at Kubbco, the reason for that is simple. It’s kind of a deal!

This shift is driven by the platform's cost-effectiveness, especially notable during key shopping periods like Black Friday and Christmas.

For media buyers, platform X represents a prime opportunity for maximizing return on investment. Its appeal is particularly strong among less-established brands seeking efficient marketing avenues.

This trend underscores a broader shift in advertising strategies, where value and audience reach are increasingly dictating platform choice, particularly for brands prioritizing quick sales or cost-effective pricing strategies.

X is emerging as a pivotal player for companies seeking high-value advertising opportunities, especially those outside the realm of established, global brands

342,KanekoaTheGreat,"🚨THREAD: Tucker Carlson on Duplicated Ballots, Falsified Tally Sheets, and Mail-In Ballot Fraud in Fulton County, Georgia

“It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia, last November (2020). That is not a conspiracy theory. It’s true.

Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA shows large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times. Pay attention to the women wearing yellow at the desk. According to VoterGA, she slides ballots into a scanning machine, removes the ballots, and then reinserts the same ballots. 

This happens multiple times. The question is, how many times were these ballots counted? Was each vote counted more than once? Fulton County won't answer that question. 

Now, one way to know that answer would be to check what are called audit tally sheets. Tellingly, for months after the 2020 election, Fulton County failed to provide more than 100,000 of those tally sheets, including 50,000 of them from mail-in ballots. 

When VoterGA finally forced Fulton County to turn over the tally sheets, the conclusion was stunning. Here's what the audit found. Seven falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals... For example, a batch containing 59 actual ballot images for Joe Biden and 42 for Donald Trump was reported as 100 for Biden and 0 for Trump. 

The seven batches of ballot images with 554 votes for Joe Biden, 140 votes for Donald Trump, and 11 votes for Jo Jorgenson had tally sheets in the audit falsified to show 850 votes for Biden, 0 votes for Trump, and 0 votes for Jorgenson. 

Wait, did you just follow that? 

How is that not flat-out criminal fraud?""",2023-11-10 19:17:55+00:00

While not common, we’ve seen at least one case where an image was originally used in one context, and then soon after reused in a different context. People naturally wondered why the original note was appearing in the new context. While we expect this scenario to continue to be rare, today’s change is designed to help people understand if and when this is happening. To further help, today’s update also makes the date on which the note was written more visible.

Grok is an AI modeled after the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, so intended to answer almost anything and, far harder, even suggest what questions to ask!

Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!

A unique and fundamental advantage of Grok is that it has real-time knowledge of the world via the 𝕏 platform. It will also answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.

Grok is still a very early beta product – the best we could do with 2 months of training – so expect it to improve rapidly with each passing week with your help.

Musk: ""In order for the mind virus to propogate it must suppress oppossing viewpionts.""

Rogan: ""Because it doesn't stand up against scrutiny?""

Musk: ""Correct.""

""Disagree and commit"" = I hate you

""Per my last email"" = Try reading, for once in your life

""Challenging landscape"" = We're going out of business, quickly

""Digital transformation"" = We're going out of business, slowly

""Let's circle back"" = We'll never speak of this again

""Take it offline"" = We'll never speak of this again

""30,000 foot view"" = I don't know what I'm saying

549,Engineering,"This has been a year full of engineering excellence that sometimes can go unnoticed. Besides all the visible changes you see on our app, here are some of the most important improvements we have made under the hood.

- Consolidated the tech stacks for For you, Following, Search, Profiles, Lists, Communities and Explore around a singular product framework.

- Completely rebuilt the For you serving and ranking systems from the ground up, resulting in a decrease 90% reduction in lines of code from 700K to 70K, a 50% decrease in our compute footprint, and an 80% increase in the throughput of posts scored per request.

- Unified the For you and video personalization and ranking models, which significantly improved video recommendation quality.

- Refactored the API middleware layer of our tech stack and in doing so simplified the architecture by  removing more than 100K lines of code and thousands of unused internal endpoints and eliminating unadopted client services.

- Reduced post metadata sourcing latency by 50%, and global API timeout errors by 90%.

- Blocked bots and content scrapers at a rate +37% greater than 2022. On average, we prevent more than 1M bots signup attacks each day and we’ve reduced DM spam by 95%.

- Shutdown the Sacramento data center and re-provisioned the 5,200 racks and 148,000 servers, which generated more than $100M in annual savings. In total, we freed up 48 MW of capacity and tore down 60k lbs. of network ladder rack before re-provisioning it to other data centers.

- Optimized our usage of cloud service providers and began doing much more on-prem. This shift has reduced our monthly cloud costs by 60%. Among the changes we made was a shift of all media/blob artifacts out of the cloud, which reduced our overall cloud data storage size by 60%, and separately, we succeeded in reducing cloud data processing costs by 75%.

- Built on-prem GPU Supercompute clusters and designed, developed, and delivered 43.2Tbps of new network fabric architecture to support the clusters.

- Scaled network backbone capacity and redundancy, which resulted in $13.9M/year in savings.

- Started automated peak traffic failover tests to validate the scalability and availability of the entire platform continuously.",2023-10-27 04:05:37+00:00

That is the right way to think about it. 

Excellent analysis by Sinofsky.",2023-10-20 16:23:51+00:00
600,Steven Sinofsky,"This thread below offers a view on why the media had so much difficulty with the news yesterday compared to the way online worked. It is an important perspective that I wanted to build upon.

It should not come as a surprise that the ""competitor"" to the media yesterday is also called ""open source"". OS News has all the properties of ""open source"" that we are familiar with from software. That means all the benefits.

It also means all of the negatives as viewed by incumbents. Much like proprietary software, the flagship media outlets view news gathering through the lens of proprietary source, only in this case the source generally means access to people, information, data that is not available to laypeople.

Since the post-Watergate era reporting has meant knocking on doors, cold calling, and most of all having relationships with established sources and experts on topics.

Conversely, these established sources and experts rely on these relationships to spoon out information and views in an effort to shape a narrative. This is a routine/process/game that has only become more institutionalized.

And those sources cold-called, much like people who did not have access to reusable code they were wildly mismatched with relative to the professionals. That is why so often these people inadvertently shaped a narrative that later proved to have problems.

In the past before open source, stories would run, information would be provided by ""sources close to"" whatever was happening in the world, and then that was the established narrative.

In today's world it is not just that everyone anywhere can post their thoughts, personal experiences, videos/photos, or anything that may or may not contribute. It is also that there is a community of people willing to test the veracity of that information. And then there is a community willing to compare the results of those tests and so on. It becomes essentially impossible for the news to be defined by a private conversation between a ""well-placed source"" and a reporter.

This reality extends even further to the vast array of sensors from satellite imagery to maps, witness recordings, historical information and records, and an incredible collection of data sources—many provided by the government itself. These sources provide more inputs to a wide-ranging community testing the validity of stories.

Finally add to this that often there are true experts on events that are no longer bound by organizations involved who are willing to lend their opinions.

It isn't simply the domain knowledge or access to the data, but the checks and balances, and the debate (vigorous as it is) across all those bits and pieces. And it is also the speed at which that system works. The participants are available around the clock, in every language, in every time zone. No newsroom has that no matter how big.

An example comparison is the world of securing and maintaining software systems. By now most in the industry know that security vulnerabilities are discovered and understood far more quickly outside the makers of those products than inside their own organizations. The information to identify, defend, and correct these problems—whether proprietary software or not—exceed that of the companies themselves. This promise of open-source software has held true from the early days. It is why the old school of keeping close to the vest in this space has so totally failed for vendors—this aspect of the proprietary model no longer works. It has been disruptive.

Events like yesterday clearly demonstrate just how disruptive the open-source news model is to events compared to the proprietary source model of the past. It also explains why there is a perception that news is far more opinion than it used to be—opinions can be branded and made proprietary far easier than trying to staff a team to compete with a community devoted to geoverification, for example.

Some long for the days of the 6pm newscast. This is most certainly a rose-colored view of the past. Those who recall this era remember being soothed by the packaging of the news. In hindsight, what we were watching was not a careful synthesis of fact-checked news but the opinions and interpretations of a small number of people with very limited expertise and even more limited information. It is only events like ""Weapons of Mass Destruction"" and others recently that have shown the limits of this process in the face of modern information, data, and analysis. I kept asking myself yesterday how different the WMD story would have been had it happened 20 years later. How would a generation of events have unfolded?

It is easy to cry ""misinformation"" but that is not what is going on. Misinformation is when actors deliberately falsify what is going on. Sharing something and having an opinion as just a random person isn't that. It is misinformation for institutions that trade on trust and truthfulness to put forth information that has not been vetted by a community or has not used all available sources. News gathering has come far enough now to know that the news is not simply what one actor said off the record confirmed by a person down the hall from that actor. The actors themselves have to deal with open-source information and make a case that stands up to the sources available to everyone.

Journalists then were exceedingly well-intentioned and did all they could at the time and acted with integrity as much as any profession. That is no different than what commercial software used to be—it was the right way and only way to make software at the time.

Disruption has many forms. We tend to focus on specific technologies and markets and the business impact. What we witnessed yesterday was a prime example of old-school versus modern reporting in a fluid, chaotic, and difficult situation. I believe it is incredibly important to take lessons from this and to adjust our view of what is reliable at the time.",2023-10-18 18:25:17+00:00

674,Elon Musk,"Regarding Lycurgus, founder of Sparta.

The pivotal moment in the creation of Sparta came when Lycurgus proposed radical laws that would transform the state into some of the greatest warriors in history.

A member of the assembly was so offended that he struck Lycurgus in the eye. Lycurgus could easily have killed him and everyone knew it. 

Instead, he stood there with his eye destroyed and invited that man to his house for dinner, ultimately convincing the man to become one of his greatest supporters.

Once the laws were in place, Lycurgus left for the temple, saying the laws could not change until he returned. Then Lycurgus starved himself to death. 

BAMF.

The lesson here is that revenge is for the weak.",2023-10-11 16:02:04+00:00

677,Community Notes,"Thank you to all the contributors who’ve been active over the last few days, helping to keep people on X informed. We wanted to share some of the impact of your work:

• In just three days, you wrote notes seen tens of millions of times.

• More than 500 unique notes relating to the attacks and unfolding events are being shown on X.

• Because of the new ""notes on media"" feature, these notes display on an additional 3000+ posts. This number grows automatically if the relevant images and video are re-used in new posts.

• Notes related to the attacks cover a wide range of topics from out-of-context war footage, to unrelated or outdated protest/celebration videos, to fake videos made with game simulators, to claims of US funding related to conflict, to claims about specific events having taken place in the conflict, and more. You can see examples on @HelpfulNotes

To further help contributors and people on X, we’re actively working on:

• Improved media matching that will help automatically show notes on even more posts with matching video and images. One improvement is rolling out today.

• In many cases, we send notifications to people who have Liked, Reposted or Replied to a post that later received a note. We’re scaling this up so that it will happen for more posts, including even the most widely-engaged posts.

• Last week we rolled out a massive speed improvement that makes notes appear across X 1.5hrs to 3.5hrs faster. We’re working on further speed gains. https://t.co/oFZB0vBOPP",2023-10-10 19:20:57+00:00

@JoeRogan: ""I'm faster in my Plaid than my Porsche, and it makes no sound... It time travels. 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds for a four-door sedan. It's bonkers. Just wait until he comes out with that little two-door Roadster. That thing will go 0 to 60 in 1.5 or 1.7, and it will handle because all of the weight will be at the bottom because that's where the weight of the battery is. So it's like a phenomenal center of gravity.""

@SugaSeanMMA: ""How crazy is that Tesla Model X Plaid? ...I got pulled over again in literally the exact same highway, same neighborhood, same cop. Those Xs are insane. Even on the highway, you're going 90, it feels like you are going 60...""

@JoeRogan: ""I taught my 15-year-old how to drive in that. It's always on Ludicrous Mode. It's easy to control. That's the difference between that and other high-powered cars. You can drive very slowly in that easily. It's like the perfect car to drive around. For a commuter car, it's the best car ever... You just plug it in at your house. You never have to go to a gas station.""

729,KanekoaTheGreat,".@JoeRogan discusses a California school indoctrinating his 5-year-old daughter into a ""woke, guilt-ridden ideology"" centered around becoming an antiracist activist.

""They hired some person to teach them that they have to be antiracist and it's not good enough not to be racist. What? My kids aren't racist at all. Why are you putting that into their head? That they have to be antiracist and call out racism.

They were trying to make them be activists. Hey, they're five. They want friends. They don't care what their friends look like. They are trying to have a good time. They're five. They're just playing.

You're indoctrinating them into this woke, guilt-ridden ideology that you are carrying around with you, and you feel like you have an obligation to impose this on children. Our goal should have always been the goals the liberals had in the 60s and 70s, which is a color-blind society. 

The Martin Luther King notion that we should treat people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin... None of the real problems get addressed, and instead, they just try to make kids feel guilty. I didn't like the woke s**t. I didn't like that they were asking kids their pronouns.""

------

Why are schools brainwashing young children into becoming antiracist activists who perceive the world predominantly through the prism of skin color?

In Dec 2021, NY Gov. Kathy Hochul invited all migrants to come to New York.

She welcomed them with open arms, quoting the welcoming message from the Statue of Liberty touting the state's sanctuary status.

A few days ago, she changed her tune due to the ongoing migrant crisis:

""If you're going to leave your country, go somewhere else. We have to let the word out that when you come to New York, you’re not going to have more hotel rooms. We don’t have capacity, so we have to also message properly.""

She advocated for people to enter the country properly:

""The smarter thing is to apply for asylum before you leave your country.”

Immigration plays a key role in our economy and labor force, but it must be done through the correct channels.

If New York is struggling to accept more migrants, then we have a serious problem!

🧵

Elon started by pointing out views on Antisemitic content are down &gt;&gt;30% since the Twitter acquisition. https://t.co/K4KswhRbEc",2023-09-28 18:18:28+00:00
870,Elon Musk,"RT @MarioNawfal: BREAKING: JEWISH LEADERS PRAISE X, AGREE ELON IS NOT ANTI-SEMITIC

Elon Also Speaks on Russel Brand & Anti-Americanism in the Educational System

In today's incredible space, Jewish leaders praised Elon and 𝕏's achievement of being the world's 'only platform with true free speech', a complete contrast of the attacks by the ADL, the CCDH and the media.

Elon starting by saying how he went to a Hebrew preschool, that he's ""aspirationally Jewish,"" and that his name is akin to being named Bob in Israel.

Ex-Israeli President Rudi agreed, joking that Elon’s name reminded him of home, considering it’s a very common name in Israel.

Short of publicly converting, I don't know how else Elon can prove he is not antisemitic 😂

The rest of the panel, including the 10th President of Israel @presidentRuvi, “the most famous Rabbi in America” @RabbiShmuley, @benshapiro,x and other Jewish leaders on the space, agreed.

ANTISEMITISM IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

Elon also cautioned around the antisemitic sentiment within the far left, especially ""elite high schools and colleges.""

He cautioned this to be a ""serious concern,"" and refers to claims by some in that community who believe Mossad were behind 9/11, also calling for the State of Israel not to exist, which he agreed is 'crazy'.

Elon also cautioned that elite high schools and colleges in the US are teaching kids 'crazy' anti-American propaganda. He's alarmed of many kids being ""indoctrinated with this madness, without any historical context"".

ANTISEMITISM ON 𝕏

Ben Shapiro, who the ADL labelled as “the biggest recipient of antisemitism”, confirmed that antisemitism on 𝕏 is SIGNIFICANTLY lower now compared to before Elon took over.

Elon confirmed this, saying antisemitism has ""objectively"" fallen on the platform.

The independent study by Sprinklr, which showed a massive drop in hate speech, proved this to be true.

Harvard Professor and prominent Jewish attorney @AlanDersh, who was a member of the ADL, applauded Elon on the 'Free Speech experiment' he is running on 𝕏, stating that 'no country in the world has really had free speech'. 

He also urged Elon to not listen to the critics.

Elon replied with 𝕏 experimenting with 'freedom of speech, not freedom of reach'. 

Elon also highlighted the importance of X's community notes successfully fighting disinformation, and applying to everyone including heads of state, advertisers and himself.

He joked how X even lost some advertisers as community notes corrected their posts 😂

Alan also praised 𝕏 to be ""the only platform in the world to not take a stance on any issues"", and achieving true free speech.

ELON ON RUSSELL BRAND

Shapiro asked Elon about ensuring people like Brand aren't demonetized unless and until they're convicted of a crime.

Elon agreed:

""He doesn't even have charges! Russell has obviously been rattling the cages of the powers that be... why now? Seems like an odd coincidence that this is happening when Russell is gaining traction questioning the conventional wisdom"".

This is true. As soon as anyone in society with a voice rattles the mainstream media’s narrative, they are hunted. 

When Brand was working with the media and pushing their views, they accepted him, but as soon as he turned his life around and 'rattled the cages', he became the enemy.

“Anyone could be accused at any time with false charges, and we can’t be destroying their lives with potentially false accusations.” - @elonmusk.

Too many people have been de-platformed, de-banked, and demonetized BEFORE their time in court. The media has become the judge, jury and executioner in the court of public opinion.

We MUST wait and abide by innocent till proven guilty.

How can anyone still claim Elon is antisemitic after this space??",2023-09-29 00:51:00+00:00
871,Mario Nawfal,"BREAKING: JEWISH LEADERS PRAISE X, AGREE ELON IS NOT ANTI-SEMITIC

Elon Also Speaks on Russel Brand & Anti-Americanism in the Educational System

In today's incredible space, Jewish leaders praised Elon and 𝕏's achievement of being the world's 'only platform with true free speech', a complete contrast of the attacks by the ADL, the CCDH and the media.

Elon starting by saying how he went to a Hebrew preschool, that he's ""aspirationally Jewish,"" and that his name is akin to being named Bob in Israel.

Ex-Israeli President Rudi agreed, joking that Elon’s name reminded him of home, considering it’s a very common name in Israel.

Short of publicly converting, I don't know how else Elon can prove he is not antisemitic 😂

The rest of the panel, including the 10th President of Israel @presidentRuvi, “the most famous Rabbi in America” @RabbiShmuley, @benshapiro,x and other Jewish leaders on the space, agreed.

ANTISEMITISM IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

Elon also cautioned around the antisemitic sentiment within the far left, especially ""elite high schools and colleges.""

He cautioned this to be a ""serious concern,"" and refers to claims by some in that community who believe Mossad were behind 9/11, also calling for the State of Israel not to exist, which he agreed is 'crazy'.

Elon also cautioned that elite high schools and colleges in the US are teaching kids 'crazy' anti-American propaganda. He's alarmed of many kids being ""indoctrinated with this madness, without any historical context"".

ANTISEMITISM ON 𝕏

Ben Shapiro, who the ADL labelled as “the biggest recipient of antisemitism”, confirmed that antisemitism on 𝕏 is SIGNIFICANTLY lower now compared to before Elon took over.

Elon confirmed this, saying antisemitism has ""objectively"" fallen on the platform.

The independent study by Sprinklr, which showed a massive drop in hate speech, proved this to be true.

Harvard Professor and prominent Jewish attorney @AlanDersh, who was a member of the ADL, applauded Elon on the 'Free Speech experiment' he is running on 𝕏, stating that 'no country in the world has really had free speech'.

But that’s just the hotel costs. NYC Mayor Eric Adams estimates the total cost of the migrant crisis will be about $12B over the next 3 years.

“We are past our breaking point,” he said. “With more than 57,300 individuals currently in our care on an average night, it amounts to $9.8 million a day. Almost $300 million a month and nearly $3.6 billion a year.”

The onus is meaningfully different if I refused to act upon a request from Ukraine vs. made a deliberate change to Starlink to thwart Ukraine.

Moreover, our terms of service clearly prohibit Starlink for offensive military action, as we are a civilian system, so they were again asking for something that was expressly prohibited.

SpaceX is building Starshield for the US government, which is similar to, but much smaller than Starlink, as it will not have to handle millions of users. That system will be owned and controlled by the US government.",2023-09-09 03:10:38+00:00

Precious little? Since Elon took over, an independent research firm found that “more than 99% of content users and advertisers see on Twitter is healthy,” and they estimated social media hate speech impressions “to be 0.003% compared to Twitter’s estimate of 0.012%.”

2. Elon Musk Blames ADL for Destroying Website He Ruined Himself - Rolling Stone

They say Elon destroyed 𝕏, yet all the metrics show the platform is breaking records (Monthly Users, User Minutes Per Day, Video Views)

3. Civil rights groups attacked by Elon Musk are mounting a counter-offensive - NBC

'Civil rights groups' 😂

4. Elon Musk’s Latest Target Hits Back - The Atlantic

Ironic how they call Elon the target, when the ADL ADMITTED to pressuring advertisers FOR MONTHS to leave 𝕏, dropping advertising revenue by 60%.

@elonmusk finally hits back, yet somehow the ADL became the target and they are hitting back?  😂

I don’t know what’s stronger, mainstream media’s HATE FOR ELON, or their LOVE FOR THE ADL?",2023-09-09 01:39:24+00:00

1116,Mario Nawfal,"BREAKING: DEBUNKING THE LIES IN ADL'S RESPONSE TO ELON

ADL's CEO broke his silence on 𝕏 and Elon by lying and trapping the host:

1) He claimed that Elon brought and amplified anti-semitism and hate speech back to the platform. 

This is NOT TRUE. The 𝕏 Safety team shared that an independent assessment by Sprinklr found that hate speech impressions on 𝕏 “to be 0.003% compared to Twitter’s estimate of 0.012%.”

2) Greenblatt clarified that he has never claimed Elon or 𝕏 are anti-Semitic: “I don’t think Twitter as a platform is anti-Semitic.”

3) When Greenblatt was asked by the host (who also identified as Jewish) if he was seeking a position or donation from 𝕏 to the ADL, he took offense to this, called it an anti-semetic trope, almost as if he was trying to cancel him, leaving the host uncomfortable and defensive.

4) Greenblatt claimed ADL is NOT publicly or privately talking to advertisers, BUT shortly after, said, “It is true we did call for a pause back in November, after the acquisition and since then” and in a previous interview he stated “if it remains a hellscape the advertisers won't take part in [Twitter]”

5) Greenblatt said the ADL is a SMALL non-profit in NY. 

NOT TRUE. The ADL is an influential organization with over 100 years of history, and according to the ADL's 2021 tax filings, the organization's total revenue was $101 million with a balance sheet of $238 million.

They ALSO received millions of dollars of indirect government funding via grants to groups in which the ADL has special interests.

6) Greenblatt says the ADL works WITH other social media platforms, including Facebook. We saw in the Politico article that @elonmusk posted that the ADL indirectly CONTROLS what can be posted on Facebook.  

7) Greenblatt claimed he doesn't know what prompted Elon's tweets, but Elon was clear it was prompted by the 60% drop in advertising from the ADL’s interference, which Greenblatt admitted in the video. 

Doesn’t seem like the meeting with X CEO Linda Yaccarino went as well as Greenblatt is making it out to be.",2023-09-06 17:48:45+00:00

It’s very simple if you have an iPhone or iPad. You can watch videos from X (formerly Twitter) by using AirPlay. 

1) Use the X (Twitter) app on your iPhone

2) Make sure you are on the same Wi-Fi network as your Smart TV (newer models), Apple TV, Roku or another Apple Air Play compatible device

3) On your iPhone, open the video you want to watch inside the X app

4) Click the AirPlay button at the bottom right of the video player on your phone  (pic of logo seen here)

5) Select the Smart TV or streaming device (AppleTV or Roku) in your home where you’d like the video to show up

When starting a pilot in a new country, there are often no pre-existing notes in local languages or on local topics. To jumpstart a local contributor community, we typically grant pilot contributors the ability to write notes from day one, without having to go through the normal process to earn writing ability. 

Now that many countries are leaving pilot and have growing contributor communities, we’ll begin requiring contributors in those countries to earn writing ability. Contributors who have already earned a Rating Impact of 5+, or have proven their ability to write helpful notes by earning a Writing Impact of 1+, will maintain the ability to write notes. Others will need to unlock it by earning a Rating Impact of 5+. More details on how to earn writing ability: https://t.co/u9voMriyDs",2023-08-23 00:13:50+00:00

If you can afford it, please subscribe to as many creators on this platform as you find interesting. 

People from every corner of the world post incredible content on 𝕏, but often live in tough circumstances, where even a few hundred dollars a month changes their life.

While we had previously said that 𝕏 would keep nothing for the 12 months, then 10%, we are amending that policy to 𝕏 keeps nothing forever, until payout exceeds $100k, then 10%. First 12 months is still free for all. 

Apple does take 30%, but I will speak with @tim_cook and see if that can be adjusted to be just 30% of what 𝕏 keeps in order to maximize what creators receive.",2023-08-02 19:56:33+00:00
