314,Ilhan Omar,"RT @Ilhan: It can‚Äôt be underscored enough: a ground invasion into the Gaza Strip would have disastrous consequences and lead to loss of life of catastrophic proportions. It would risk pulling the U.S. into a rapidly-escalating broader regional conflict. We should fully oppose it. 

A ground invasion would make an untenable humanitarian disaster even worse. It would not only put the lives of more and more Palestinian civilians at risk, but also Israelis, the hundreds of hostages held by Hamas, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza

This war has reportedly already taken the lives of over 1,400 Israelis, and over 7,000 Palestinians. Fuel and electricity remain shut off for the 2.3 million residents of Gaza‚Äîa war crime‚Äîand communications and internet services are now down across Gaza. Over 1 million have fled from their homes. 

Residents remain trapped in this open-air prison, without any exits, including American citizens. Civilians are told to flee their homes‚Äîbut are then killed by airstrikes after fleeing. Gaza‚Äôs health care system is already in a state of ‚Äúcomplete collapse,‚Äù according to the Health Ministry, with over two-thirds of healthcare facilities shut down. Only 84 trucks of aid have been able to enter the Rafah land crossing. 

A ground invasion would turn a horrific regional tragedy into potentially a global one. Both Iran and Hezbollah have threatened to escalate militarily if Netanyahu launches a ground invasion into Gaza. The United States has asked the Israeli government to delay an invasion so it can place air defenses in the region to protect U.S. troops, heightening the risk of U.S. involvement. 

We have to ask: what is the endgame here? Does a ground invasion increase security and safety for Israelis or Palestinians? No. In fact, the Biden Administration has reportedly warned that Israel does not have achievable military objectives for a Gaza ground invasion. 

It is important to note that this ground invasion is deeply unpopular. Two-thirds of Americans and fully eighty percent of Democrats support the commonsense position of a ceasefire to end this horror. And according to a recent poll by Israeli paper Maariv, a ground invasion is not supported by a majority of the Israeli people either. 

The solution to this horror, as ever, is a negotiated peace‚Äîwith Israelis and Palestinians enjoying equal rights and security guarantees. That peace may seem impossible in the fog of war, but it starts with us calling for an end to the war, for the release of hostages by Hamas, and for the international community to seek accountability for these atrocities.

Most of all, we must remember that we are all part of one human family, that the wanton destruction of lives will only pull us apart and perpetuate the seemingly endless cycle of violence. https://t.co/sotXh4jpF1",2023-10-27 22:38:03+00:00
315,Rep. Ilhan Omar,"It can‚Äôt be underscored enough: a ground invasion into the Gaza Strip would have disastrous consequences and lead to loss of life of catastrophic proportions. It would risk pulling the U.S. into a rapidly-escalating broader regional conflict. We should fully oppose it. 

A ground invasion would make an untenable humanitarian disaster even worse. It would not only put the lives of more and more Palestinian civilians at risk, but also Israelis, the hundreds of hostages held by Hamas, and the hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza

This war has reportedly already taken the lives of over 1,400 Israelis, and over 7,000 Palestinians. Fuel and electricity remain shut off for the 2.3 million residents of Gaza‚Äîa war crime‚Äîand communications and internet services are now down across Gaza. Over 1 million have fled from their homes. 

Residents remain trapped in this open-air prison, without any exits, including American citizens. Civilians are told to flee their homes‚Äîbut are then killed by airstrikes after fleeing. Gaza‚Äôs health care system is already in a state of ‚Äúcomplete collapse,‚Äù according to the Health Ministry, with over two-thirds of healthcare facilities shut down. Only 84 trucks of aid have been able to enter the Rafah land crossing. 

A ground invasion would turn a horrific regional tragedy into potentially a global one. Both Iran and Hezbollah have threatened to escalate militarily if Netanyahu launches a ground invasion into Gaza. The United States has asked the Israeli government to delay an invasion so it can place air defenses in the region to protect U.S. troops, heightening the risk of U.S. involvement. 

We have to ask: what is the endgame here? Does a ground invasion increase security and safety for Israelis or Palestinians? No. In fact, the Biden Administration has reportedly warned that Israel does not have achievable military objectives for a Gaza ground invasion. 

It is important to note that this ground invasion is deeply unpopular. Two-thirds of Americans and fully eighty percent of Democrats support the commonsense position of a ceasefire to end this horror. And according to a recent poll by Israeli paper Maariv, a ground invasion is not supported by a majority of the Israeli people either. 

The solution to this horror, as ever, is a negotiated peace‚Äîwith Israelis and Palestinians enjoying equal rights and security guarantees. That peace may seem impossible in the fog of war, but it starts with us calling for an end to the war, for the release of hostages by Hamas, and for the international community to seek accountability for these atrocities.

Govt troops are claiming that al-Shabaab is fleeing Camaara, southeast of Ba‚Äôadweyne.

But this is a tricky area. It has changed hands many times in recent years. Al-Shabaab largely vacated these areas without a major fight, so govt troops and local fighters have a lot more work to do in the coming days and weeks.

591,Harun Maruf,"UPDATE: Somalia military offensive:

Govt troops are moving to revive the military offensive against al-Shabaab. Within the last few days Govt forces moved into El Lahelay (Ceel Lahelay), and El Garas (Ceel Garas) in Galgudud region.

Following an IED explosion in El Garas troops moved out and al-Shabaab moved back in but officials insist the troops are still on the outskirts. These troops, the same unit that entered El Lahelay appear to be cautious and they are staying together.

A second relaunch of offensive is expected on Wabxo (Wabho) from Mahaas (Maxaas) direction where @HassanSMohamud spent days remobilising.

In the northern front, govt forces and local fighters entered Hinlabi (Xinlabi) on Tuesday after Al-Shabaab moved out. A parallel offensive is expected from Wisil-Bacaadweyne front.

No significant movement has been reported on the coastal area, an offensive to retake Masagaway and El Dheer (Ceel Dheer). That offensive will also need troops going back to Gal‚Äôad (Galcad) and Budbud, both key to holding El Dheer.

Having side, it‚Äôs unclear if troops will hold the town and villages they capture in a revived offensive. 

So far indications are they are inclined to be slightly shifting their tactic from holding to staying unpredictable and on the move. Mobile operations that target al-Shabaab hideouts rather than holding empty towns and becoming sitting ducks is the tactic advised by observers. 

But before we reach that stage, first we have to see preparations peak and  the offensive regain its full momentum. That has not happened yet.",2023-09-12 13:53:21+00:00

905,Ilhan Omar,"RT @Moazzam_Begg: Images from my return trip to #Bagram #Afganistan

I‚Äôm describing how prisoners were hooded and their hands shackled above their heads to the cage door and punched and kicked. 

I‚Äôm explaining how an Afghan taxi driver by the name of Dilawar was beaten to death after being tied up like this for days and that image has been engraved in my head ever since.

I‚Äôm explaining how US soldiers would throw Qurans over cell doors when prisoners asked for them or drop kick the book like a football. When we first arrived soldiers ripped the Quran into pieces and threw them into buckets of excrement.

An American Egyptian interrogator told the US soldiers not to allow us to call the athan, recite the Quran or pray in congregation because that allowed to communicate with one another. If anyone did, they‚Äôd be tied up - just like Dilawar.

We had two small bottles of water per day. If we used them to wash or make wudhu we‚Äôd have nothing to drink. So most made tayammum. I did so for a year and forgot the correct sequence of wudhu by the time I arrived in #Guantanamo.

Despite this, I‚Äôm also telling them how I managed to memorise Surah Al-Baqarah - the largest chapter of the Quran - in this very spot. 

Im explaining how they‚Äôd built tiny one square metre isolation cells and kept us there for days on end during interrogation periods. 

I‚Äôm telling them about the screams of the woman I used to hear I thought was my wife; and how news of the birth of my son reached me here. 

Im retelling them how I saw all of this in a  vivid dreamI had 8 years before I came to Bagram.

I‚Äôm describing how British intelligence agents - who‚Äôd questioned me in UK several years before - came here many times and interrogated me while prisoners were screaming and tortured to death. 

Other than Guantanamo, I lived in this place away from home longer than anywhere else, so I knew it very well. 

This place is now abandoned and very dark - both physically and metaphorically. 

Returning here was an indescribable experience. I couldn‚Äôt help but to breakdown when recounting my thoughts and memories.

It‚Äôs no longer a torture facility but I did ask that IEA preserve some part of the place so that it‚Äôs never forgotten. They said they intend to do so but also they‚Äôd like to make it into a centre of learning, where young people can study for the future without forgetting the darkness of the past.
