And the reach of hate speech on Twitter continues to represent an extremely small fraction of the overall conversation.

This past March, Twitter partnered with Sprinklr to understand, measure and reduce hate speech using its AI-based model and to further our commitment to create a brand-safe environment for our agencies and advertisers.

Today we‚Äôre sharing an update that includes all of April and May 2023.

Sprinklr‚Äôs independent model continues to show the reach of daily English-language hate speech impressions is even lower than Twitter‚Äôs own model estimates.

Sprinklr estimates the average daily number to be 0.003% compared to Twitter‚Äôs estimate of 0.012% for the period of January 1, 2023 to May 31, 2023. Additionally, we estimate hate speech impressions are 30 percent lower on average vs. pre-acquisition.

In June we significantly expanded our Freedom of Speech, Not Reach policy enforcement, which dramatically reduces impressions on harmful content. And all indicators for June and July show sustained progress.
