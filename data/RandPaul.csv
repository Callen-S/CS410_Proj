20,Rand Paul,"RT @HannahDCox: Dr. Fauci is set for a dramatic showdown in Congress

Go ahead and pencil January 8th and 9th into your calendar because the showdown is sure to be epic. For the first time during this session of Congress, Dr. Anthony Fauci will appear before the House for a transcribed interview alongside seven hours (per day) of testimony.

https://t.co/4dsPsgmNan

The appearance is a long time coming as Fauci‚Äôs lawyers seem to have been negotiating the terms of testimony since it was first requested by Congress back in February of 2023. His testimony will be before the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, chaired by @RepBradWenstrup.

A memo released publicly by the subcommittee reads, ‚ÄúAs the former Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Chief Medical Advisor to the President of the United States, you have knowledge pertinent to both investigating and evaluating the federal government‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic but also preparing for future pandemics. The Select Subcommittee expects you to answer questions truthfully, to the best of your ability and recollection, and consistent with House and Select Subcommittee rules and precedents.‚Äù

As people may recall, that last line is worth repeating as Fauci has notoriously stonewalled and lied his way through numerous other confrontations with members of Congress, most notably @RandPaul. 

The Kentucky senator was the first to really corner Fauci on the existing evidence (that we had since the Spring of 2020) showing the NIH used a passthrough organization (EcoHealth Alliance) to illegally fund gain-of-function (GOF) research (cough, animal torture!) in the Wuhan lab.

https://t.co/mGbBzqruZo

We had that evidence all along thanks to the @WhiteCoatWaste (where I am a Fellow), a free market animal welfare organization committed to ending taxpayer-funded animal torture that had been investigating GOF research long before the pandemic broke out. 

But thanks to a cover-up operation that included the White House, significant pressure on social media platforms from within the administration, and a complicit mainstream media, Fauci had evaded having to answer serious questions on that evidence until @RandPaul entered the chat.

Here's a flashback to his epic takedown of Fauci back then:
https://t.co/ffLkOn7FyQ

Thanks to Paul‚Äôs own scientific expertise as a doctor, Fauci and the NIH finally had to admit to their illegal activity. From there the dominos have fallen quickly. The vast majority of the public now believes the COVID-19 virus originated and leaked from the Wuhan lab. Putting two and two together, that means it could have also been created in that lab with the help of our tax dollars being illegally funneled to it. The FBI and the Department of Energy have also added their names to the list of entities that believe the virus came from the lab.

But the American people have yet to get real concrete answers from the people closest to the situation, and it‚Äôs imperative that we do. As we speak, the US is still funding this kind of research through a multitude of different agencies. Congress has made great headway on curtailing this activity and the market is also beginning to speak as scientists are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain grants for this kind of work.

While those are fantastic developments, it‚Äôs still not enough. We need final answers on how the NIH evaded the bans on GOF (that need to be re-implemented). We need to know who knew what and when. We need to know the decision makers who were involved in stagnating the flow of information. And most importantly, we need to know if failures happened in that lab that led to this leak so that efforts can be made to ensure the public is protected from this kind of reckless incompetence in the future.

Real leaders say, ‚Äúthe buck stops here.‚Äù They own their mistakes, take responsibility, and work to do better in the future. No one is suggesting Fauci has that kind of backbone, but there is reason to think more than a few Congressional leaders who will be questioning him do.",2023-12-01 15:45:02+00:00

78,Michael Shellenberger,"NEW DOCUMENTARY: ""The Censorship Files""

How much would you pay to protect your freedom?

by @lwoodhouse & @shellenberger 

One year ago, we and other journalists gained access to the Twitter Files. What we discovered shocked us. Not only were highly partisan and ideological individuals within Twitter censoring people for holding views with which they disagreed, they were often doing so on behalf of US government officials and contractors with the FBI, CIA, and Department of Homeland Security.

And so, one year later, we are happy to announce a new, full-length documentary film, ‚ÄúThe Censorship Files.‚Äù You can see the trailer above. The film, made by Leighton Woodhouse and Jonah Markowitz, will bring you inside the Twitter Files and the race to the Supreme Court, which will hear the Missouri v. Biden censorship case early next year.

Today we must ask you a personal question: what price would you put on your freedom? Many of us tell ourselves that freedom is priceless: we would sacrifice everything, die even, to protect our freedoms and keep America a free nation. Even if we weren‚Äôt willing to die or go to prison for our nation, we would make a significant financial investment to protect it.

We are asking you to make a far more modest payment: less than $9/month, or about half the cost of a Netflix subscription.

A subscription to Public is an investment in our investigative reporting, our free speech campaigning, and the final production and distribution of ‚ÄúThe Censorship Files,‚Äù a film that will change how Americans think about free speech.

We believe $9/month is a tiny investment to pay to ensure that, in the future, you can read what you want to read, watch the programs you want to watch, and voice your opinions.

‚ÄúThe Censorship Files‚Äù will be a landmark film in educating younger Americans, who are more censorial than their elders, about America‚Äôs remarkable history of strong free speech protections. They will learn about the Civil Rights movement, the right of the New York Times to publish ‚Äúthe Pentagon Papers,‚Äù and the right even of pro-Nazi and pro-terrorism activists to march freely through America‚Äôs streets.

‚ÄúThe Censorship Files‚Äù will reveal the origins and scope of the Censorship Industrial Complex, its leaders and architects, and its victims of censorship, from moms sharing stories about the Covid vaccine‚Äôs side effects on their children to two of the world‚Äôs foremost experts on the Covid response, Harvard‚Äôs Martin Kulldorff and Stanford‚Äôs Jay Bhattacharya.

Finally, we will use ‚ÄúThe Censorship Files‚Äù to build a new free speech movement in America, city by city, campus by campus, from the grassroots up. Because if we can‚Äôt persuade America‚Äôs youth to support free speech, then the First Amendment is just some words on a piece of paper.

We can‚Äôt save the First Amendment without you. We can‚Äôt even finish ‚ÄúThe Censorship Files‚Äù without you. This is not complicated. We need more paid subscribers. We need more than 10% of our subscribers to contribute thirty cents daily.

If we could get 30% of our free subscribers to support our movement, I believe that we would have a fighting chance to save our first freedom and the other pillars of democratic civilization along with it.

One year ago, we didn‚Äôt even know we lived in a heavily censored society. Today, we have ripped back the veil of the Censorship Industrial Complex and are on the cusp of defunding and dismantling it.

Such a process will take years but won‚Äôt take a decade. It may even happen much more quickly than that, depending on the actions of the Supreme Court and Congress.

What‚Äôs certain is that we can‚Äôt do it without our paid subscribers ‚Äî and we don‚Äôt want to do it without our unpaid ones. We promise that, in the future, you‚Äôll be grateful you funded the fight for our first freedom.",2023-11-21 14:47:11+00:00

133,Rand Paul,"RT @shellenberger: New Documents Reveal US Department Of Homeland Security Conspiracy To Violate First Amendment And Interfere In Elections

Emails released by the U.S. House of Representatives, when combined with the Twitter Files, reveal a sweeping and secretive effort by Stanford and DHS officials, two of whom are now business partners

Stanford Internet Observatory‚Äôs Alex Stamos (Left) and former DHS-CISA Director Chris Krebs (Right) are now business partners. The current CISA Director is Jen Easterly (Center). [All photos from Getty Images]

The idea that the officials within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security worked with a Stanford think tank to censor ordinary Americans and thus interfere in the 2020 elections is a debunked conspiracy theory, say journalists in the mainstream news media. The Republicans spreading that conspiracy theory, say journalists with the New York Times, Washington Post, and New Yorker, are also waging a witch hunt against university researchers who study misinformation. It is for that reason that the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO), which is home to those researchers, had long refused Republican requests for their emails and data.

But newly released documents suggest that SIO may have had a very different motivation for not sharing their files with Congressional investigators: they show that the idea for sweeping government censorship, in which the Stanford think tank played a central role, came from the Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs Cybersecurity and Internet Security Agency (CISA). According to one of CISA‚Äôs censorship partners, the so-called ‚ÄúElection Integrity Partnership‚Äù (EIP), which was ostensibly separate from CISA, was created at its behest.

In an internal Atlantic Council email sent on July 21 2020, Graham Brookie, the senior director of the Council‚Äôs ‚ÄúDisinformation Forensic Research Lab,‚Äù (DRFLab), wrote to a colleague to say the following: ‚ÄúI know the Council has a number of efforts on broad policy around the elections, but we just set up an election integrity partnership at the request of DHS/CISA and are in weekly comms to debrief about disinfo, IO, etc.‚Äù (Emphasis added.)

Brookie‚Äôs acknowledgment contradicts the claim made by the EIP that the idea for the project ‚Äúcame from four students that the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) funded to complete volunteer internships at [CISA].‚Äù Brookie‚Äôs email also contradicts the testimony of the SIO‚Äôs Director, Alex Stamos, earlier this year, who told Congressional investigators that the idea for EIP was his.
There is evidence that DHS-CISA had started interfering in elections several months earlier. On April 15, 2020, the DHS-CISA chief of ‚ÄúCountering Foreign Influence Task Force,‚Äù Brian Scully, emailed Twitter executives about a ‚ÄúGovernment-Industry Meeting,‚Äù that was held the next day. The issues discussed included election information.
By November, Twitter executives, Scully, and at least one of the Stanford interns were on a Signal text messaging app group together.

According to the U.S. Supreme Court, it is ‚Äúaxiomatic‚Äù that the US government ‚Äúmay not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.‚Äù Whether it was Stamos or the Director of CISA at the time, Chris Krebs, it‚Äôs clear that the U.S. government was directly involved in the Stanford-linked effort to censor Americans.

The documents are revelatory in showing that CISA officials, Stanford officials, and social media executives worked together in secret in ways that not only violated the First Amendment but also interfered in the 2020 elections by attempting to censor protected political speech, particularly that of conservatives and Republicans.

Although we do not know the effects of EIP‚Äôs activities on the 2020 election results, and although some of these activities occurred after election day, it‚Äôs clear that SIO, EIP, and CISA engaged in viewpoint-based censorship that amounts to attempted interference leading up to the election.

There was virtually no separation between CISA and Stanford employees in 2020. On September 30, 2020, an EIP staffer said that Stamos and Krebs were texting each other ‚Äúwith some regularity.‚Äù

Since 2021, former CISA Director Krebs, and Stanford Internet Observatory Director Stamos have owned a consulting firm that works for private equity, aerospace, and satellite companies, among many others.

In 2020, CISA officials and personnel from EIP were often on emails together, and CISA‚Äôs personnel had access to EIP‚Äôs tickets through an internal messaging system, Jira, which EIP used to flag and report social media posts to Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.

The Biden administration and journalists have insisted that CISA did not violate the constitution because it was not coercive and merely engaged in ‚Äúswitchboarding‚Äù activities, acting as a middleman. But, the new documents reveal that CISA included a threatening disclaimer in its switchboarding communications, which stated that ‚Äúinformation may also be shared with law enforcement or intelligence agencies.‚Äù",2023-11-13 19:13:36+00:00

In an internal Atlantic Council email sent on July 21 2020, Graham Brookie, the senior director of the Council‚Äôs ‚ÄúDisinformation Forensic Research Lab,‚Äù (DRFLab), wrote to a colleague to say the following: ‚ÄúI know the Council has a number of efforts on broad policy around the elections, but we just set up an election integrity partnership at the request of DHS/CISA and are in weekly comms to debrief about disinfo, IO, etc.‚Äù (Emphasis added.)

Brookie‚Äôs acknowledgment contradicts the claim made by the EIP that the idea for the project ‚Äúcame from four students that the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO) funded to complete volunteer internships at [CISA].‚Äù Brookie‚Äôs email also contradicts the testimony of the SIO‚Äôs Director, Alex Stamos, earlier this year, who told Congressional investigators that the idea for EIP was his.
There is evidence that DHS-CISA had started interfering in elections several months earlier. On April 15, 2020, the DHS-CISA chief of ‚ÄúCountering Foreign Influence Task Force,‚Äù Brian Scully, emailed Twitter executives about a ‚ÄúGovernment-Industry Meeting,‚Äù that was held the next day. The issues discussed included election information.
By November, Twitter executives, Scully, and at least one of the Stanford interns were on a Signal text messaging app group together.

According to the U.S. Supreme Court, it is ‚Äúaxiomatic‚Äù that the US government ‚Äúmay not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.‚Äù Whether it was Stamos or the Director of CISA at the time, Chris Krebs, it‚Äôs clear that the U.S. government was directly involved in the Stanford-linked effort to censor Americans.

The documents are revelatory in showing that CISA officials, Stanford officials, and social media executives worked together in secret in ways that not only violated the First Amendment but also interfered in the 2020 elections by attempting to censor protected political speech, particularly that of conservatives and Republicans.

Although we do not know the effects of EIP‚Äôs activities on the 2020 election results, and although some of these activities occurred after election day, it‚Äôs clear that SIO, EIP, and CISA engaged in viewpoint-based censorship that amounts to attempted interference leading up to the election.

There was virtually no separation between CISA and Stanford employees in 2020. On September 30, 2020, an EIP staffer said that Stamos and Krebs were texting each other ‚Äúwith some regularity.‚Äù

Since 2021, former CISA Director Krebs, and Stanford Internet Observatory Director Stamos have owned a consulting firm that works for private equity, aerospace, and satellite companies, among many others.

In 2020, CISA officials and personnel from EIP were often on emails together, and CISA‚Äôs personnel had access to EIP‚Äôs tickets through an internal messaging system, Jira, which EIP used to flag and report social media posts to Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.

The Biden administration and journalists have insisted that CISA did not violate the constitution because it was not coercive and merely engaged in ‚Äúswitchboarding‚Äù activities, acting as a middleman. But, the new documents reveal that CISA included a threatening disclaimer in its switchboarding communications, which stated that ‚Äúinformation may also be shared with law enforcement or intelligence agencies.‚Äù",2023-11-07 22:25:24+00:00

The U.S. government was never meant to be a militarized empire, since freedom and empire are mutually exclusive. But alas, those fateful decisions were made well before we were born. 

In typical empire fashion, the U.S. government has overextended itself militarily around the world, engaging in endless wars. Those wars come at a severe cost to us, as our standard of living precipitously deteriorates.

Debts cannot be endless. Ultimately, the interest payments will overwhelm. The U.S. government is now paying $1 TRILLION per year in interest alone.

Americans will have to rethink the role of government ...either by choice, or by unavoidable necessity.

Senator @RandPaul questions Department of Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas and FBI Director Christopher Wray during the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on Tuesday, October 31, 2023 (Getty Images)

Over the last year, mainstream news reporters have dismissed every new revelation of government censorship. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) officials who primed social media executives to censor the Hunter Biden laptop were simply on guard for Russian disinformation, they said. White House officials who demanded that Facebook censor accurate information about Covid-19 vaccine side effects were simply trying to save lives, journalists argued. And the sweeping effort by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to demand, alongside academic institutes, social media censorship of Covid and election information was, a ‚Äúpublic-private partnership‚Äù to ‚Äúcounter misinformation,‚Äù many reporters insisted.

But many independent journalists disagree. We and others have documented how these efforts blatantly violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which explicitly prohibits the government from ‚Äúabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.‚Äù The FBI had Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop in its possession since 2019 but primed social media executives in the summer of 2020 to view it instead as Russian disinformation, resulting in its censorship.

White House officials also demanded that social media companies censor accurate information about the side effects of the Covid vaccine. Facebook complied, fearing retaliation from the White House, even though executives knew that doing so would increase, not decrease, ‚Äúvaccine hesitancy.‚Äù

Emails obtained through discovery in the Missouri v. Biden case revealed how officials from the federal government threatened, berated, and pressured social media companies. In light of this evidence, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals partially upheld an injunction in the Missouri v. Biden case, ruling that some government agencies had coerced platforms into censoring protected speech. And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals viewed the sweeping public-private effort overseen by DHS‚Äôs Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to censor disfavored views on vaccines and elections to be in violation of the First Amendment. The court demanded that CISA, along with the FBI, CDC, and the White House, refrain from coercing or significantly encouraging social media companies to censor users.

After this sequence of events, many rightly wondered how the heads of the various government agencies within the Censorship Industrial Complex would respond to public questioning by members of Congress. After months of anticipation, this finally occurred this week, when Senator Rand Paul interrogated DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and FBI Director Christopher Wray.

Senator Ted Cruz similarly grilled National Science Foundation (NSF) Director Dr. Sethuraman Panchanathan earlier this month on that agency‚Äôs distribution of millions of dollars to promote ‚Äúthe science of countering social media myths and disinformation as well as the development of digital tools to track and censor so-called misinformation.‚Äù

In 2019, WHO published a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of face masks for the prevention of influenza, involving ten high-quality studies with more than 6000 participants.

Its conclusion:

""There was no evidence that face masks are effective in reducing transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."" [1]
In May 2020, CDC conducted its own systematic review and meta-analysis, this time of fourteen high-quality studies.

Its conclusion:

""Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."" [2]
In early 2020, CDC and WHO were discouraging mask-wearing, calling it ineffective.

However, by April through June 2020, advice had reversed and masks became recommended. Here's CNN [3]:
In other words, there was universal scientific consensus pre-April 2020 that masks did not work. But, post-April 2020, what had once been scientific consensus had suddenly become ""misinformation"".

How does something like that happen?

How does scientific consensus become ""misinformation"" within just a few months, without any change in the actual science?

This is a gravely serious question that must be answered.

731,"Tracy H√∏eg, MD, PhD","Jeff, I appreciate you diving into this & discussing our correspondence. I know both of us want to get at the truth about boosters and advocate for better research/data in the future.

I just want to point out some big picture things: The Arbel study, as we discovered & described, had a 94.8% lower non-covid mortality rate in the unboosted. This is absolutely huge and the authors did not disclose this at the time of the publication. (wow) [this is a great falsification endpoint, though, by the way that absolutely should have been included from the beginning, though it never would have been published if it had been]   

The COVID mortality rate was almost exactly the same amount lower among the boosted (94.6%) as their non covid mortality advantage. (also, wow)  The simplest explanation for the boosted population's advantage vs covid is they were healthier... 20x healthier/less likely to die than unboosted... hard to overemphasize how huge this is     

Now, I have consistently said health differences COULD explain the full advantage the booster was associated with vs death considering boosted 95% less likely to die of other causes! But I never said I knew it was the whole story or that booster effectiveness was 0%. We just don't know.    

But it is a herculean task to adjust for this 95% mortality difference between boosted and unboosted. IMO this should have been a non-starter as & Arbel et al's paper should never have been published with such a huge difference in health/death risk between these two groups.    

 In Arbel's response (which, to clarify to some of the commenters, was published simultaneously with our correspondence) they now concede the 90% booster advantage they originally published was too high and inadequately adjusted for. They also concede our calculation of a 94.8% non-covid mortality advantage among the boosted was correct. Why were these facts not disclosed earlier?     

And are we to believe the info they are now providing us will lead us to the true estimate? Are they providing us with full info now? Why are they not making their data publicly available? I appreciate the methodology you are trying to use (though I was not convinced by the Hungarian study's methodology) but we already have a falsification endpoint that is THE SAME as the supposed booster advantage; again I don't think we have enough info to say the booster advantage vs covid is NOT 0% with the limited info we have.    

In summary, I believe the Arbel et al study is too fundamentally biased to provide useful information and the authors are trying to save it right now with these adjustments-  But there are likely many residual confounders, they have not disclosed critical data before and they are not willing to make the raw data publicly available at all.  

These are huge problems. I would look to less biased studies with full data transparency and falsification endpoints in the absence of rcts, but we both agree RCTs are better. I do like the idea of using an off season for flu, to give a disease free period to look at all non flu deaths but obviously this is trickier for covid.

But again with Arbel et al, we have a pretty good falsification endpoint- NON covid mortality advantage - and it is THE SAME as the advantaged that was attributed to the booster. That does not mean for sure the booster effect was 0, but I really don't think we can prove it wasn't with the data we have. The burden is on the authors to prove the booster benefit and I don't think they have.  

I am happy about the fact@NEJM published our correspondence. I also appreciate you highlighting the importance of the exchange we had there and adding your thoughts. Even if we disagree on this one, I enjoy your posts.",2023-07-22 00:43:21+00:00

President Reagan asked Wyeth why they couldn‚Äôt make safer vaccines.

Wyeth answered that they couldn‚Äôt because vaccines are ‚Äúunavoidably unsafe.‚Äù

And so, anybody who claims vaccines are safe and effective, the industry itself got immunity from liability by convincing President Reagan and Congress that vaccines are ‚Äúunavoidably unsafe.‚Äù
